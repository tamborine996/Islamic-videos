1
00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:16.025
Now I will humbly request Hazrat Qibla Pir Suleman Muhammad Shabir Shah Sahib Gilani to quench the thirst of our hearts and enlighten us about the life of Hazrat Baba Ji Sahib

2
00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.204
to illuminate our hearts and minds.

3
00:00:19.977 --> 00:00:25.554
Naray Takbeer! Naray Risalat! Naray Takbeer! Naray Risalat!

4
00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:37.465
Chura Sharif - we praise and send blessings upon the beloved Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, the generous Messenger.

5
00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:49.377
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I...

6
00:00:50.791 --> 00:01:03.519
...this dignified and simple gathering for the interview, question and answer session, has been organized by the website Chura Sharif.

7
00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.028
And may Allah keep this initiative going, may it continue.

8
00:01:09.028 --> 00:01:19.667
The personality about whom this interview is being conducted today, the questions and answers being exchanged...

9
00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:24.107
...may it continue long., The status, the greatness

10
00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:32.786
the dignity of that personality - I can only say this much: their greatness and dignity is such that by speaking of it

11
00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:41.392
we must illuminate our hearts and minds., Since I have already mentioned that Darbar Aliya Chura Sharif is the center

12
00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:49.485
the capital of the Naqshbandi Mujaddidi silsila, from which thousands and millions of people have benefited...

13
00:01:49.769 --> 00:02:03.739
...by speaking of it, we must illuminate our hearts and minds., Since I have already mentioned that Darbar Aliya Chura Sharif is the center

14
00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:16.101
the capital of the Naqshbandi Mujaddidi silsila, from which thousands and millions of people have benefited, are benefiting

15
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.017
and will continue to benefit.

16
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:34.080
...have been benefiting, are benefiting, will continue to benefit., Today, anyone who has even a slight connection with Tasawwuf

17
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:46.928
or carries love for the Sufis in their heart, whoever has any connection to any silsila, whoever is a servant of any elder

18
00:02:46.928 --> 00:02:50.404
whoever beholds any Sufi saint...

19
00:02:51.734 --> 00:03:08.279
...I say with great conviction that when Chura Sharif is mentioned, when its discussion begins, there cannot be any scholar, any Sufi

20
00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:20.222
anyone connected to Tasawwuf who is not aware of Chura Sharif. More than a century has passed...

21
00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:30.875
...since Chura Sharif was established. Our forefathers benefited millions of people.

22
00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:45.397
This is not just a matter of writing or speaking - look, at that time from Afghanistan to all four corners of the world

23
00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:49.669
especially to Hindustan, to Iran...

24
00:03:50.847 --> 00:04:08.040
...to Syria and Turkey - this chain of spiritual benefit was spread by Baba Ji Sahib or by their servants and disciples.

25
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:18.643
But the situation was such - I will briefly mention - that at that time...

26
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:27.938
...there was no confrontation with the government. But the traditions of our ancestors were kept alive.

27
00:04:27.938 --> 00:04:37.809
The choice was: either accept the government's authority or become a migrant. They did not accept the government's authority.

28
00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:42.943
At that time, the government was non-Muslim. They did not submit.

29
00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:55.578
...while thousands of people of that era accepted the authority and today their descendants number in thousands and millions.

30
00:04:55.578 --> 00:05:07.276
But Baba Ji, the founder of Chura Sharif, declared: "I am a beggar at the door of Mustafa. There is no greater inheritance for me than this.

31
00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:12.458
And if there is any inheritance, it is this torn mat of mine."

32
00:05:12.893 --> 00:05:24.833
"This is a patched blanket to keep the shoulders warm, and this is an old water pot. No one can take this from me.

33
00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:38.029
But I will speak what is pleasing to Allah and His Messenger." Now the situation was also that since there was no era of media

34
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.858
no written documentation...

35
00:05:42.678 --> 00:05:53.085
But when the written tradition began, it was still not enough for people to quench their thirst.

36
00:05:53.085 --> 00:06:08.153
And this is a sad truth that must be acknowledged - those whose rights were not properly given, they continued their work in their own way.

37
00:06:08.153 --> 00:06:10.322
But Alhamdulillah...

38
00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:22.590
...that Baba Ji Sarkar's blessed name - Hazoor Baba Ji Pir Syed Noor Muhammad Gilani, may Allah's mercy be upon him - was illuminated then

39
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.527
is illuminated now, and will remain illuminated until the Day of Judgment.

40
00:06:28.527 --> 00:06:39.280
Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji Pir Haidar Shah, the one with the black shawl, Sarkar - you are asking about that personality who was a living...

41
00:06:39.817 --> 00:06:54.295
...example of his ancestors, understand him as the image of the pure ones, understand him as a treasury of Mustafa's wealth.

42
00:06:54.295 --> 00:07:08.423
From whose lips always flowed either Quranic wisdom or lessons from the life of Mustafa Kareem. I will elaborate further.

43
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:19.689
Since it was not the era of media, this was a looted and plundered caravan that departed from Baghdad, stopped at various places

44
00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:29.799
reached Bukhara, and from there this looted caravan, speaking the truth at every stop, reached the Kohat-Mianwali area, Teerah.

45
00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:34.258
What happened there, from there this caravan moved on...

46
00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:46.380
...to Tirah Shimali and Waziristan, to Akhun Khel. From there this caravan, which consisted of three or two members, moved on.

47
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:55.672
One brother stayed in Tirah Sharif. The younger brother went to a place called Dar Samand near Bannu Road.

48
00:07:55.672 --> 00:07:59.267
Dar Samand - this is a missionary term...

49
00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:12.975
They settled in Dar Samand, and their descendants exist there today - the Sadaat-e-Gilan of Dar Samand, who are our cousins.

50
00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:25.187
One person - this caravan of four people arrived in 1867 or 1868, in sixty-eight, and established the dera at Chura Sharif.

51
00:08:26.062 --> 00:08:35.829
Great hardships, great difficulties and trials. But they never abandoned the truth. They did not care for worldly wealth.

52
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:45.111
Hundreds of acres of land, large estates were sent as bribes - just say one word, accept the authority of the time.

53
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:55.444
This was when the current district of Attock - district Attock didn't exist then - the district at that time was Shahpur Sadr...

54
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:06.507
But they said no, these estates and lands mean nothing to me compared to the status of one morsel from the door of Mustafa.

55
00:09:06.507 --> 00:09:18.071
As Hazrat said: "On your morsels grows the kick of the stranger." This brings us to Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji Pir Haidar Shah, the blessed one.

56
00:09:18.071 --> 00:09:22.765
What we have heard, since there was no written record...

57
00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:41.671
Your birth was in Tirah Sharif. You were born there, you carried on the silsila there. But you are travelers of the second caravan.

58
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:52.212
The first caravan that settled Chura Sharif - you are not from that caravan.

59
00:09:52.799 --> 00:10:00.431
You are from the second or third caravan, whose culmination brought you to the court of Chura Sharif. So this was your lineage.

60
00:10:00.431 --> 00:10:08.665
This was your birth. Now, by Allah's knowledge and what we have heard or read - who suggested your name? Who bestowed your first feeding?

61
00:10:08.813 --> 00:10:34.888
I heard from the elders that your blessed birth was in Tirah Sharif. Your name was suggested by your grandfather, Hazrat Baba Ji...

62
00:10:38.092 --> 00:10:58.868
Syed Faqeer Muhammad, may Allah's mercy be upon him, suggested the name. And your first feeding was also given by Hazrat with his own hands.

63
00:10:59.557 --> 00:11:22.208
He raised his hands and prayed: "My Lord, this grandson You have given me as a prince - my Lord, I have named him Haidar Shah

64
00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:28.551
in connection with Mawla Murtaza...

65
00:11:29.324 --> 00:11:40.373
...Haidar-e-Karrar., My Lord, preserve the honor of this name I have given, and preserve the honor of my first feeding

66
00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:53.763
and make him the bearer of those qualities that belonged to Sarkar Mawla Ali and Haidar-e-Karrar." This was the tradition of the first feeding.

67
00:11:53.763 --> 00:11:58.352
And regarding the childhood - you had brothers...

68
00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:14.816
I heard from them - just one or two things I heard: The first thing was that from childhood, as is the way of Sufis

69
00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:29.622
from childhood there was great piety, there was a tradition of taqwa. Playing and frolicking that children do...

70
00:12:30.175 --> 00:12:43.113
...staying away from that., And I also heard that your peers, your contemporaries, even in childhood you would tell them: "Brother

71
00:12:43.113 --> 00:12:51.971
we have not come into this world for play. We should not waste our precious time in play.

72
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:58.242
We have come to do some work in this world, and we must do it."

73
00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:05.813
So those who were your age, I heard, would ask: "What work is there, brother?

74
00:13:05.813 --> 00:13:16.720
Tell us." You would say: "The greatest work is to spread the word of truth to the common people. And the teachings of my father..."

75
00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:31.376
"...I must spread them." These were the childhood circumstances. What else was there, how it was - only Allah knows best.

76
00:13:31.376 --> 00:13:46.167
These two things I heard, I have shared. Now about your early education - where did you receive it and who were your teachers?

77
00:13:49.133 --> 00:14:06.868
Some time ago, in our elders' homes, this tradition existed that early education was given at home.

78
00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:15.647
It was given at home because that era was such...

79
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:29.430
...that the pearls of knowledge distributed at home were very precious.

80
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:45.347
For early education, Baba Ji Sarkar learned from his father and from his uncle Hazoor...

81
00:14:46.508 --> 00:14:52.295
...who was the great scholar of his time, an unparalleled authority.

82
00:14:52.295 --> 00:15:03.019
His blessed name was Hazrat Baba Ji Muhammad Syed Muhammad Gul Nabi Shah, may Allah's mercy be upon him - your paternal uncle.

83
00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:08.040
They were running the educational institution at that time.

84
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:16.212
And then your grandfather, Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Faqeer Muhammad, may Allah's mercy be upon him...

85
00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:29.240
...their elder brother, the senior - from Afghanistan to Hindustan, he was known as Mullah Ji.

86
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:43.498
Because only in Pakistan and Hindustan, perhaps in Bangladesh, in East Pakistan - the word Mufti is used...

87
00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:49.771
But in Afghanistan and other matters, the word Mullah was used.

88
00:15:49.771 --> 00:15:58.208
Mullah meant one of piety, one of knowledge, one who has memorized enough to give fatwas.

89
00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:09.110
And your great-grandfather's blessed name was Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Deen Muhammad Shah, may Allah's mercy be upon him

90
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.051
also known as Hazrat Mullah Ji.

91
00:16:12.689 --> 00:16:17.386
The world called him Mullah Ji Sahib., From him too, some knowledge was gained

92
00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:25.335
since he had established a proper educational institution at Chura Sharif, where he would teach his own children and family members.

93
00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:31.839
This was the tradition of teaching at that time. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

94
00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:37.921
Now this question arises: Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Haidar Shah Sahib - with his name comes "Badshah" (King)

95
00:16:37.921 --> 00:16:41.295
and "Kali Chadar Wala" (the one with the black shawl)...

96
00:16:43.418 --> 00:17:01.467
I heard that your elders at some gathering - your grandfather Hazoor, your uncle Hazoor - mentioned something about the black shawl...

97
00:17:01.467 --> 00:17:12.109
about the noble Prophet's, the blessed Prophet's, black shawl, black blanket...

98
00:17:13.355 --> 00:17:30.518
...it penetrated so deeply into the heart, that from childhood to youth and beyond, he took black cloth, had a shawl made from it

99
00:17:30.518 --> 00:17:43.159
and instead of wearing it draped, he would place it on his shoulders according to the Sunnah...

100
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:54.483
And when someone asked about this black shawl, Sarkar said: "My Master used the black blanket

101
00:17:54.483 --> 00:18:05.637
so I say this is my Master's Sunnah." And it became such a part of his life, that black shawl...

102
00:18:06.308 --> 00:18:16.772
...that he became famous., At Chura Sharif, among your brothers and elders, he became known as "Haidar Shah, the one with the black shawl

103
00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:24.182
Sarkar." And to this day at Chura Sharif, when they say "the one with the black shawl, Sarkar"...

104
00:18:24.162 --> 00:18:33.369
...it is understood by all in our family, all the young men, my brothers and elders - they understand that "the one with the black shawl

105
00:18:33.369 --> 00:18:42.847
Sarkar" refers to Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Haidar Shah Sahib, may Allah's mercy be upon him. This was the story of the black shawl. Alhamdulillah.

106
00:18:42.847 --> 00:18:52.189
Now this term "Badshah" - there are two meanings. One is metaphorical - when someone is carefree and independent, they are called Badshah.

107
00:18:52.189 --> 00:18:53.747
And when someone has...

108
00:18:54.436 --> 00:19:05.434
...royal qualities, he is called Badshah., Now the state of independence and the state of absorption

109
00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:19.512
the nearness to the Divine and nearness to the Prophet was such that whoever came - great or small - sat down, left, said salaam

110
00:19:19.512 --> 00:19:23.802
asked about wellbeing, and that was it.

111
00:19:24.727 --> 00:19:40.224
Beyond that, the royal lifestyle was such that throughout his life he wore the finest clothes - he used the tahband (lower garment)

112
00:19:40.224 --> 00:19:49.452
he used the kurta, he used the waistcoat, he used a beautiful walking stick...

113
00:19:50.663 --> 00:20:01.028
So this connection came from his family - your elders would say that this son of ours is a Badshah, a king.

114
00:20:01.028 --> 00:20:14.202
So in this context, this title was given - understand it as a title or a designation - that Haidar Shah Badshah would wear royal attire.

115
00:20:14.202 --> 00:20:19.725
But in the world of Tasawwuf, among his contemporaries...

116
00:20:20.262 --> 00:20:31.783
Among his contemporaries I don't know, but I will certainly quote from the land of Kasur. Many people in England have witnessed this.

117
00:20:31.783 --> 00:20:43.304
In Kasur, there was a saint from the Chishti silsila, Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Syed Naqeeb Ullah Shah Sahib, may Allah's mercy be upon him.

118
00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:49.628
A reliable companion told me that in their gathering, discussion arose...

119
00:20:50.485 --> 00:20:58.148
In the blessed gathering of Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Naqeeb Ullah Shah Sahib - they were a great Sufi, a great scholar.

120
00:20:58.148 --> 00:21:06.416
They were not ordinary, they were great scholars, and at that time a pir was recognized only when they were great scholars.

121
00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:09.978
They were among those. They were great Sufis as well.

122
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:18.045
When the discussion arose in their gathering from different angles, they took notice and asked whose discussion is this?

123
00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:29.365
A servant said it's about Chura Sharif., In a state of spiritual ecstasy, as the companions who were present relate

124
00:21:29.365 --> 00:21:31.997
in a remarkable ecstatic state

125
00:21:31.997 --> 00:21:46.125
you said: "The one you are discussing - Pir Haidar Shah Sahib - he was the Badshah of Tariqat." So he was the Badshah of Tariqat - this is no ordinary statement.

126
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.023
So this also happened - that his contemporaries and even those after them, the people of Tasawwuf, the people of spiritual insight

127
00:21:55.023 --> 00:22:02.429
they acknowledged this. Look, he was the Badshah of Tariqat. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

128
00:22:02.429 --> 00:22:10.637
There is a tradition in our family, and it exists in many families, that the bay'ah (spiritual allegiance) happens within the family.

129
00:22:10.637 --> 00:22:15.268
Now whose hands does the bay'ah happen on? The person of authority decides.

130
00:22:15.755 --> 00:22:25.292
Like these sons of mine - their bay'ah is on the hands of their paternal grandfather's younger brother

131
00:22:25.292 --> 00:22:29.406
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Muhammad Ali Shah Sarkar.

132
00:22:29.406 --> 00:22:42.029
Both, or all three - the youngest wasn't there yet - but Usman Shah and Fazl Usman Shah or Fazl Noman Shah's bay'ah was on their hands.

133
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:45.677
This tradition continues to this day...

134
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:57.102
...that bay'ah happens, has been happening., For example, my nephews, may Allah grant them safety - both or all three nephews

135
00:22:57.102 --> 00:23:07.237
their bay'ah is on the hands of Hazrat Baba Ji Sarkar Sirhindi Sarkar, probably Sayyid Muhammad Masoom Sirhindi Madani

136
00:23:07.237 --> 00:23:16.086
in Madinah Munawwarah. Both of their bay'ah is on his hands. Similarly, we have other family members...

137
00:23:16.623 --> 00:23:28.334
...whose bay'ah is within the family., But Alhamdulillah, this Mujaddidi and Naqshbandi lineage - from what I've heard

138
00:23:28.334 --> 00:23:40.442
some young people had an inclination toward Hazrat Sarkar Baba Ji Muhammad Fazan Usman Jan Sirhindi's direct discipleship.

139
00:23:40.442 --> 00:23:43.221
Similarly, Hazrat Baba Ji...

140
00:23:44.163 --> 00:23:53.005
Sarkar Syed Haidar Shah Badshah, the one with the black shawl, Sarkar - his bay'ah was on his grandfather's hands.

141
00:23:53.005 --> 00:24:01.226
The one the world knows in Tasawwuf as Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Faqeer Muhammad, may Allah's mercy be upon him.

142
00:24:01.226 --> 00:24:04.872
He had two khilafats (spiritual successions)...

143
00:24:05.105 --> 00:24:14.756
One khilafat he received from his grandfather, and the second khilafat was from his father, Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Gul Nabi

144
00:24:14.756 --> 00:24:21.994
also known as Zarif Hawali Sarkar., He would say with great love: "I have served two kings

145
00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:33.255
and from two emperors I have received this chain of spiritual succession." Now there is a beautiful question - the bay'ah happened in '64...

146
00:24:34.366 --> 00:24:51.372
I was studying at Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia at that time., But from Chura Sharif - at that time you would stay at Dhok Matheen Sharif

147
00:24:51.372 --> 00:25:03.175
and I would come to serve you whenever I was free - before going to Lahore and even during...

148
00:25:03.307 --> 00:25:11.342
...my educational period., By my good fortune, Sarkar asked me: "What do you do, where are you?" I said: "Sarkar

149
00:25:11.342 --> 00:25:16.507
I'm in Lahore." "What do you do?" I said: "I study." "Where do you study

150
00:25:16.507 --> 00:25:25.547
what do you study?" I said: "Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia." You said: "I know Mufti Muhammad Hussain Naeemi Sahib." I said: "Yes

151
00:25:25.547 --> 00:25:31.002
he is among our teachers, he teaches, and there are other teachers as well."

152
00:25:31.859 --> 00:25:41.333
After a pause, you told me: "Sometimes make time to go to Sarkar Data Ganj Bakhsh's blessed presence.

153
00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:54.466
Don't be proud about sitting at the headside, sit at the feet. And from there, after some time, also go visit Lahori Qalandar, Allama Iqbal.

154
00:25:54.466 --> 00:26:00.752
He will also give you something." This was a spiritual instruction.

155
00:26:00.867 --> 00:26:09.368
So I started going. It's a tradition in Lahore that on Thursdays we definitely go to Data Sahib., And sometimes to Allama Iqbal

156
00:26:09.368 --> 00:26:18.404
may Allah's mercy be upon him, Lahori Qalandar - Qalandar, this term Baba Ji Pir Haidar Shah first used, may Allah's mercy be upon him.

157
00:26:18.404 --> 00:26:23.893
He was the first to call him Qalandar, no one said it before. So I would go there.

158
00:26:23.893 --> 00:26:30.655
Now let me tell you something interesting - two karamats (miracles) of Allama Iqbal I will mention...

159
00:26:32.069 --> 00:26:48.329
...that I personally witnessed - this is not something I heard. The first was in '65 or '66, I was traveling by bus, and I was on the bus.

160
00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:57.992
In Gujrat, there is a beautiful town called Lala Musa, where there's a junction...

161
00:26:59.778 --> 00:27:04.981
When we arrived there, it was about thirty degrees, summer season

162
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:13.706
and a thought came to my mind - I have such love and devotion for Allama Iqbal, may Allah's mercy be upon him

163
00:27:13.706 --> 00:27:16.988
but I have never visited him (his grave).

164
00:27:16.988 --> 00:27:25.954
Just as I thought this, I dozed off, and in that doze I saw that Allama Sahib is standing next to me in the bus.

165
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:29.842
You put your hand on my shoulder.

166
00:27:29.842 --> 00:27:44.106
At that time I used to carry a notebook - there was also a tradition of note-taking - whatever was heard, you would write it down.

167
00:27:44.106 --> 00:27:56.177
In this notebook were also some couplets I had heard in gatherings, some written in couplet form. So Allama...

168
00:27:57.018 --> 00:27:59.531
Now, what did he make me write?

169
00:27:59.531 --> 00:28:13.884
He instructed me: "Write: This lesson is a provision for me from Lahori Qalandar - Being a beggar of Mustafa is the most complete lesson in the world." He made me note this down

170
00:28:13.884 --> 00:28:22.723
I noted it. And when I opened my eyes from that drowsy state, it was written there, but Hazrat was not there.

171
00:28:22.723 --> 00:28:26.130
After that, the elder's instruction was...

172
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.541
..."Brother, go visit Allama Iqbal's place

173
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:46.212
he will give you something from there." Then once I complained: "I can't find two or three poems of yours with 'Ruhani' takhallus (pen name)." Then in a dream state...

174
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:55.939
Hazrat Allama Lahori Qalandar told me: "I have written a naat (poem in praise of the Prophet) that has not been published

175
00:28:55.939 --> 00:29:05.404
but it lies in my books., The first couplet of that naat is: 'The glance of Ashqi gives provision, lifting the veil of secrets

176
00:29:05.404 --> 00:29:12.992
though he sits hidden in seclusion, like a flickering lamp.'" Now when the matter of visiting came...

177
00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:23.230
I would often go to Hazrat's service there. From there, besides book learning, there was much practical learning.

178
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.829
What was the practical learning?

179
00:29:25.829 --> 00:29:36.225
Like that verse of Aazam Lahori: "He sits on a mat, yet his throne is the heavens." From there, practical lessons were received.

180
00:29:36.225 --> 00:29:43.536
What was the practical lesson? That despite having everything, one must maintain humility.

181
00:29:43.988 --> 00:29:51.123
Keep oneself humble, don't show off. Practically, this was received there.

182
00:29:51.123 --> 00:30:02.597
And as far as spiritual connection is concerned, Alhamdulillah, whatever there is, it is the blessing of Sarkar's gaze.

183
00:30:02.597 --> 00:30:13.590
The beautiful moments - every single moment was beautiful. But in my childhood, these are the beautiful moments...

184
00:30:14.296 --> 00:30:23.401
Straw mats are spread, and the King of Chura Sharif is seated., Hazoor Baba Ji arrived in splendor, my respected father arrived

185
00:30:23.401 --> 00:30:30.570
my esteemed uncle arrived, grandfather's younger brother Hazoor Qibla Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib arrived

186
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:33.368
and your paternal cousin grandfather...

187
00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:38.934
...who was a very great scholar of his time. A very great scholar.

188
00:30:38.934 --> 00:30:48.427
His blessed name was Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji Pir Syed Maulana Syed Musa Sahib, may Allah's mercy be upon him. They were paternal cousins.

189
00:30:48.427 --> 00:30:56.361
They are seated., And then others, among them your other paternal cousin, Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Syed Muhammad Shafi

190
00:30:56.361 --> 00:31:01.110
may Allah's mercy be upon him, and they were engaged in discussion.

191
00:31:02.812 --> 00:31:11.985
The discussion was about a tap installed in the mosque - what is the ruling on drinking water from it?

192
00:31:11.985 --> 00:31:21.608
A lively discussion was happening, with forceful questions and answers., And in these questions and answers

193
00:31:21.608 --> 00:31:32.312
Baba Ji said - you said: "My elders" - you didn't say which ones - they said: "If that tap is endowed for the mosque...

194
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:39.393
...then its water will not be permissible for the general public, it will be for the worshippers.

195
00:31:39.393 --> 00:31:47.997
If it's for general use, then common people can take water from it. Now this tap installed in the mosque - it was installed for the mosque.

196
00:31:47.997 --> 00:31:53.507
Move it slightly onto the wall outside. It's the mosque's tap, not the mosque's property.

197
00:31:53.791 --> 00:32:00.152
It was Sarkar's tap, take it outside so people can also drink." These were beautiful moments.

198
00:32:00.152 --> 00:32:08.224
Beautiful moments with brothers - during childhood, these intense matters were being discussed in this way., Similarly

199
00:32:08.224 --> 00:32:15.748
let me give another example here - this custom of cooking food after death that common people in Pakistan have

200
00:32:15.748 --> 00:32:19.512
what we call charity food in our customs, in Kashmir...

201
00:32:19.829 --> 00:32:35.681
...I don't remember exactly, but I remember this much - someone asked whether it's permissible or not.

202
00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:47.338
So smilingly, Baba Ji said to Maulvi Sahib - with warmth and familiarity...

203
00:32:47.487 --> 00:32:53.108
So those were beautiful moments. Very beautiful moments - they are still before my eyes today.

204
00:32:53.108 --> 00:32:59.985
Sometimes traveling on horseback, a caravan of servants alongside. Sometimes talk of Madinah the Pure is happening.

205
00:32:59.985 --> 00:33:08.179
Tears of longing are flowing. And what is the naat-reciter reciting? At that time, what was recited was: "Your face's days, O beloved..."

206
00:33:08.294 --> 00:33:14.341
"...Dale Suniya, Sard Hamama, Kamli Wale" - this was one naat.

207
00:33:14.341 --> 00:33:27.898
And another naat I remember two or three lines of - what a beautiful moment it was, what a magnificent gathering - there were naat-reciters

208
00:33:27.898 --> 00:33:33.556
there were elders. I was a small child then, I remember...

209
00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:41.460
The naat that was being recited was: "Every moment my eyes remain fixed on the one with the black blanket, Sarkar.

210
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:49.988
My eyes keep looking again and again at the path of the Arab camel-rider." This naat was being recited, so those were beautiful moments.

211
00:33:49.988 --> 00:33:56.573
But since I was a child - in '64 you passed away. These two or three things from my memory are preserved.

212
00:33:57.347 --> 00:34:08.498
Now regarding Pakistan's creation - this is a long political topic., But I will summarize: When the time came to create Pakistan

213
00:34:08.498 --> 00:34:19.039
in Hindustan - if I say a hundred percent, it would still be correct - ninety-nine percent of the shrines joined together

214
00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:26.358
determined that Pakistan must be created. The slogan was: "We will create Pakistan!"

215
00:34:27.654 --> 00:34:37.602
The rallying cry was: "We will take Pakistan!" In this context, Hazrat's residence was in Lahore, Wassanpura Chopira Wala.

216
00:34:37.602 --> 00:34:48.447
Maulana Muhammad Bakhsh Muslim, may Allah's mercy be upon him, was Hazrat Baba Ji Muhammad Ali Jinnah Quaid-e-Azam's special advisor.

217
00:34:48.447 --> 00:34:57.172
So Quaid-e-Azam Sahib said: "Brother, the matter is this - Maulana Muslim Sahib's word is not being heard."

218
00:34:57.978 --> 00:35:07.016
"Now what should we do?" So Muslim Sahib said: "The situation is that there is a saintly elder whose contribution to politics is significant.

219
00:35:07.016 --> 00:35:11.246
The world knows him as Pir Jamaat Ali Shah., If he joins our cause

220
00:35:11.246 --> 00:35:18.169
it would be a great thing." When you went to them - now if anyone wants to dispute this, that's their choice

221
00:35:18.169 --> 00:35:24.965
but what Maulana Muslim Sahib himself told me, they said: "I am bound by my spiritual master's command..."

222
00:35:25.873 --> 00:35:31.694
"Wherever he directs me, I will go., I don't know what Quaid-e-Azam is, who he is, but yes

223
00:35:31.694 --> 00:35:39.391
Pakistan should be created." Maulana Muslim Sahib took Muhammad Ali Jinnah with him to Wassanpura to Baba Ji's presence

224
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:48.252
and came with the message., Baba Ji said: "Come back tomorrow for the answer." The next day, you summoned Ameer-e-Millat, Hazrat Hafiz Ji

225
00:35:48.252 --> 00:35:50.193
may Allah's mercy be upon him.

226
00:35:51.557 --> 00:35:53.557
He presented himself to you.

227
00:35:53.557 --> 00:36:01.816
You told him: "Jamaat Ali Shah, I am giving you this command - start a vigorous movement and go out with the flag of Pakistan.

228
00:36:01.816 --> 00:36:10.763
Allah will grant you success." Hazrat Ameer-e-Millat said: "Hazrat, if Pakistan is created, I will go out. If it's not created, then what?"

229
00:36:10.743 --> 00:36:18.605
So Sarkar said: "Jamaat Ali Shah, as far as Sarkar (the Prophet) is concerned, it has been approved.

230
00:36:18.605 --> 00:36:28.983
This Muslim country will definitely be created, and the credit for creating it will go to the Muslims." Pir Jamaat Ali Shah Sahib...

231
00:36:28.983 --> 00:36:35.980
Then he used to tell me in Punjabi: "My heart, my liver was so filled - I started crying.

232
00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:40.700
What a blessing - I will earn Pakistan and this Pakistan..."

233
00:36:40.882 --> 00:36:45.504
And then after that, the fatwa that was issued - the truth must be spoken

234
00:36:45.504 --> 00:36:53.671
one should not diminish one's own stature - this fatwa that was issued from Kichaucha Sharif, the current Hazrat Hasan Shah Sahib

235
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:58.103
may Allah's mercy be upon him, Kichauchvi, from Mahra, from Kichaucha.

236
00:36:58.103 --> 00:37:07.727
The fatwa stated: "Any Muslim who does not vote for Muslim League - it will become impermissible to bury him in a Muslim graveyard." This was a powerful

237
00:37:07.727 --> 00:37:09.691
powerful fatwa, a strong fatwa.

238
00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:20.401
And the endorsement of this fatwa was given by Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Haidar Shah - that yes

239
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:29.452
this fatwa from Kichaucha Sharif is absolutely correct - taking it in hand...

240
00:37:29.432 --> 00:37:44.971
All those institutions that bear his name - Jamia Haideria - you also have Jamia Haideria, and Alhamdulillah it's at Chura Sharif as well

241
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:58.696
in Lahore as well, in Rawalpindi as well. There's an institution running near Fouj Colony, the Jamia Haideria Jadeedah...

242
00:37:59.537 --> 00:38:05.121
...is running., Similarly, locally at Matheen Sharif also Jamia Haideria is running, in Lahore it's running

243
00:38:05.121 --> 00:38:09.244
then at Hanjal Verial Road it's running, near Jago Jahanabad it's also running.

244
00:38:09.244 --> 00:38:15.246
Many institutions bear Baba Ji's name because whatever we receive is through the blessing and charity of your name.

245
00:38:15.246 --> 00:38:19.840
And it's our duty - wherever we establish an institution, it should be in Hazrat's name.

246
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:31.718
As for patronage - in Lahore, since you spent a significant portion of your life there, you greatly patronized Hizb-ul-Ahnaf

247
00:38:31.718 --> 00:38:39.314
patronized Jamia Numania. And regarding mosques - you constructed many mosques...

248
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:47.997
You left an imam there and established a regular stipend for him

249
00:38:47.997 --> 00:38:58.228
saying your duty is twofold: you must increase the congregation and teach Quran to children.

250
00:38:58.228 --> 00:39:07.681
You must teach Quran, you must teach Hadith Sharif. And after that, if any madrasa...

251
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:18.273
...in those days would come to you, you wouldn't send them away empty-handed. You would grant something, patronize them.

252
00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:26.674
We have many documented proofs of where all you provided patronage., In Makka Mukarrama as well

253
00:39:26.674 --> 00:39:37.465
there was an institution - I don't remember its name, Jamiatul Salafiyyah - though it wasn't as it is today - there too...

254
00:39:37.445 --> 00:39:42.069
We have the correspondence showing that you patronized there as well.

255
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:49.440
And at that time, in Madinah Tayyibah there was a madrasa that you patronized and would send your share there.

256
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.254
And then Jamia Mujaddidiyya Sirhind Sharif

257
00:39:52.254 --> 00:40:01.636
the madrasa established at Hazrat Mujaddid's blessed shrine - at that time you also patronized it and would send annual contributions there.

258
00:40:01.636 --> 00:40:05.123
And you would say with great pride: "That brother...

259
00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:16.873
Why shouldn't I spend money on Mujaddid Pak's service? It's being spent." But you cannot imagine the state of adherence to Shariah!

260
00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:25.004
The state of Shariah adherence was such that even in gatherings, no one could do anything wrong.

261
00:40:25.004 --> 00:40:32.798
I remember that a scholar came, I won't mention his name, who had wound a turban on a cap...

262
00:40:33.285 --> 00:40:40.975
And its tassel was very large., You called him close, seated him with affection, and said: "Maulana

263
00:40:40.975 --> 00:40:48.276
I have read that having a small tassel here is considered permissible according to some views.

264
00:40:48.276 --> 00:40:53.946
But keeping such a large one enters the realm of extravagance." Similarly

265
00:40:53.946 --> 00:41:00.473
Shariah adherence was such that even a young girl could recite the call to prayer...

266
00:41:01.314 --> 00:41:09.880
And there was restriction on that too - that there is a standard., Similarly, I saw that when you would wear your blessed attire

267
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:17.242
you would have it tailored properly, and if someone made a mistake, you would correct them: "This is not right

268
00:41:17.242 --> 00:41:25.273
this shouldn't be done this way." Even in eating matters, there was such discipline - "Everyone must sit together to eat

269
00:41:25.273 --> 00:41:30.562
" and you would say: "Make rows, sit with Bismillah, and pass to each other..."

270
00:41:31.183 --> 00:41:38.281
And there are many matters where I could list numerous teachings for you. Firm but not harsh.

271
00:41:38.281 --> 00:41:46.372
There was no harshness - it was a way of explaining, not harsh, not strict. You would explain beautifully.

272
00:41:46.372 --> 00:41:55.302
Our relatives from Kotli, Azad Kashmir - two elders came for a visit. Why did they come? Their names I will tell you.

273
00:41:55.302 --> 00:41:59.502
One elder's name was Maulana Muhammad Bakir Ali Khan...

274
00:41:59.718 --> 00:42:09.801
Their descendants are in Bolton, England. And the other one who came was Hakeem Bilayat Khan. Their descendants are in Bolton too.

275
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:18.488
Hakeem Bilayat Khan, they would serve medicine, and Maulana Bakir Sahib was a religious scholar, he had a beard.

276
00:42:18.488 --> 00:42:28.882
So Baba Ji Sarkar asked: "Maulvi Bakir Khan, you have a beard, this one has a beard - he's Bilayat Khan - why don't you have a beard?"

277
00:42:29.823 --> 00:42:47.022
"Show him your example and then he'll also..." - not scolded, but indicated with love and wisdom.

278
00:42:47.576 --> 00:42:51.728
In Baba Ji's gathering, his duty was to give Hadith lessons.

279
00:42:51.728 --> 00:43:01.347
Hazoor would also listen attentively, would listen to two lessons, and when the lesson ended, Hazrat would provide the explanation himself.

280
00:43:01.347 --> 00:43:09.789
And he wouldn't say "this is wrong." He would say: "This point was also missed by Maulana Sahib, as happens in such chains

281
00:43:09.789 --> 00:43:17.195
things get left out - if it comes to my mind, let me complete it for him." This was the manner of teaching.

282
00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:25.400
Love of the Prophet - Alhamdulillah, it has been filled to the brim in my noble family. SubhanAllah!

283
00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.994
Now look - in Pakistan there have been very great scholars.

284
00:43:29.994 --> 00:43:37.513
One of them was Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi, may Allah's mercy be upon him, the Lover of Quran.

285
00:43:37.513 --> 00:43:46.507
He had come to visit, had come to pay respects. Looking here and there, looking around, he addressed Zahuri Sahib...

286
00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:58.676
And with him was Maulana Muhammad Sahar Gulfroosh - addressing these people, he said: "Brothers, Zahuri, listen - here at Chura Sharif

287
00:43:58.676 --> 00:44:07.506
one must proceed very carefully. Here is the fragrance of Mustafa's love, the Mustafa's fragrance is wafting.

288
00:44:07.506 --> 00:44:16.662
This is the headquarters, and these people who have come out, they have come out as offshoots from this place..."

289
00:44:17.115 --> 00:44:23.681
And I still remember that scene too - when the anniversary at Chura Sharif was being celebrated.

290
00:44:23.681 --> 00:44:31.478
Hazoor Qibla, Zia-e-Ummat, Pir Muhammad Karam Shah Al-Azhari Sahib, with great affection for Mustafa, was present.

291
00:44:31.478 --> 00:44:39.206
And the scene was such that all the descendants were swaying in ecstasy and tears were streaming from their eyes.

292
00:44:39.206 --> 00:44:41.738
When they stood for the salutation...

293
00:44:41.921 --> 00:44:48.327
When this line of the salaam was recited: "Those whose prostration the prayer niche has adopted..." - no one, as I saw

294
00:44:48.327 --> 00:44:52.943
everyone was in such a state that Pir Karam Shah Azhari also fell into prostration...

295
00:44:53.328 --> 00:44:58.756
All the descendants also fell into prostration, and all the attendees fell into prostration.

296
00:44:58.756 --> 00:45:06.249
And the one reciting the salaam recited this verse approximately eighteen times., And when he stopped, he said: "For God's sake

297
00:45:06.249 --> 00:45:13.270
please raise your heads - I don't understand what I should do." This love of the Prophet is a wealth. It is widespread.

298
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.809
Even today I say to you with great pride...

299
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:26.147
I proclaim that whoever wants can catch hold of any descendant, seat him, ask him any question, and see what he says., And even today

300
00:45:26.147 --> 00:45:34.524
our general state is such that when the young men sit together - I am usually among them - when we sit together

301
00:45:34.524 --> 00:45:42.978
I often say to the descendants: "Should I recite a naat to you?" Among them is one descendant named Syed Deen...

302
00:45:47.227 --> 00:45:56.190
Very good voice, very melodious., And Hazrat Maulana Allama Sahib Zia Muhammad, may his shadow extend, he is also a very great scholar

303
00:45:56.190 --> 00:46:03.616
a Qazi, and their style of reciting is very beautiful. Similarly, among the young descendants there are many...

304
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:11.948
Sitting like disciplined students - these are the ones who are spreading throughout the country.

305
00:46:11.948 --> 00:46:16.683
Now this is a recent story - we were sitting in the mosque, and he said to me: "Uncle

306
00:46:16.683 --> 00:46:22.702
you're sitting quietly." I said: "My mood isn't right." He said: "Should we create some atmosphere for you?"

307
00:46:23.289 --> 00:46:31.439
And what atmosphere did they create? Three of them sat together and started reciting a naat. And what naat did they recite?

308
00:46:31.439 --> 00:46:39.788
It was inside the mosque, Baba Ji was there, they sat inside the mosque. The naat was: "Your river of mercy is flowing openly.

309
00:46:39.788 --> 00:46:43.167
I have received my charity, my work is progressing.

310
00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:49.398
Your name is on the Throne, your name is everywhere." And when they reached the final verse...

311
00:46:50.508 --> 00:46:54.141
"As for me - whatever I have is the charity of Mustafa.

312
00:46:54.141 --> 00:47:01.342
His portion grows on my lips." All the descendants who were seated - what a scene it was, with tears flowing.

313
00:47:01.342 --> 00:47:07.488
Alhamdulillah, the treasure of Mustafa's wealth was being distributed at that time as well...

314
00:47:07.468 --> 00:47:15.461
It is being distributed even more today, and every young person, Alhamdulillah, you will see - they will mature.

315
00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:21.884
And in their heart and mind, the love for Mustafa and especially today, great people aside

316
00:47:21.884 --> 00:47:29.734
descendants aside - but I say with pride that my Baba Ji's descendants, Alhamdulillah, on the matter of belief

317
00:47:29.734 --> 00:47:35.517
they are so firm and so staunch that no one can shake them, no one can move them.

318
00:47:35.497 --> 00:47:52.739
In the month of Ramadan, go to Madinah Munawwarah, and you'll see Chura Sharif's young men are representing there. Many have gone.

319
00:47:52.739 --> 00:48:08.522
Go to any country, Chura Sharif representation is there., All the young men, Masha'Allah, my Baba Ji's light of the eye

320
00:48:08.522 --> 00:48:24.306
my Baba Ji's blessed offspring, the entire world - each one better than the other - is spreading this treasure of love.

321
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:37.062
Since at that time ships were used, what they called steamers - multiple visits to the blessed court.

322
00:48:37.062 --> 00:48:52.066
Because at that time there were no planes, it took three to four months just to reach for Hajj. There were many visits to Hajj.

323
00:48:52.066 --> 00:49:05.888
I don't have the exact count, but I know there were many visits, Alhamdulillah, by Baba Ji Sahib to Madinah Tayyibah.

324
00:49:05.888 --> 00:49:10.142
This is a very interesting question.

325
00:49:10.257 --> 00:49:19.568
The elders of that time, his contemporaries - after this chain, each would give the lesson of their own spiritual path.

326
00:49:19.568 --> 00:49:22.776
I will specifically mention Golra Sharif.

327
00:49:22.776 --> 00:49:31.775
This is not - today generally there's a sad situation - that in hearts there's a strange kind of envy, let's say...

328
00:49:33.797 --> 00:49:43.807
We have received this excellent teaching that whoever is miserly can never become wealthy. He who is miserly can never become a Sufi.

329
00:49:43.807 --> 00:49:52.839
So with great conviction - Alhamdulillah, we mention the Sufis, we strengthen our faith - like the court of Golra Sharif

330
00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:55.248
the esteemed Aqeelat Barakhan...

331
00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:04.423
And on the pulpit there, those who go there, two books used to lie - Mohyiddin Ibn Arabi's Fusus al-Hikam

332
00:50:04.423 --> 00:50:13.575
and Masnavi Sharif of Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Mahr Ali Shah, may his blessings continue - lessons would be given from it.

333
00:50:13.555 --> 00:50:22.042
In our family too, and especially Baba Ji Sahib - regularly at night, quoting from Maktubat Sharif

334
00:50:22.042 --> 00:50:33.907
giving reference to Mujaddid Pak's Maktubat, Sarkar used to say: "This is my share, this is what would happen - my Imam Rabbani said this

335
00:50:33.907 --> 00:50:38.499
my Imam Rabbani said this." This tradition continued.

336
00:50:38.783 --> 00:50:40.885
After every Maghrib prayer

337
00:50:40.885 --> 00:50:51.399
this program would continue - but the phrase would be: "My Imam Rabbani said this." And you would often say: "Read Maktubat Sharif

338
00:50:51.399 --> 00:51:01.024
embrace it, and gain some benefit from it." As for physical description - then I'll describe to you what he was like...

339
00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:04.908
just understand: moon-like face, silver-white...

340
00:51:05.732 --> 00:51:17.457
...fair complexion, and on the head a white turban, on the shoulders a black shawl, locks hanging down.

341
00:51:17.457 --> 00:51:32.597
And as Riaz-ud-Din Sahib has a line in a naat - not that I'm attributing it to them - their couplet is: "Those who wrap their tresses

342
00:51:32.597 --> 00:51:34.760
page after page..."

343
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:45.012
"...a glance of prophetic splendor, locks swaying, graceful upon the shoulders." This verse too can be applied.

344
00:51:45.012 --> 00:51:51.442
Riaz-ud-Din Sawordi Sahib gave me this verse in Madinah Pak, about 25 years ago.

345
00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:59.803
So I remember that the blessed beard was white and immaculate, Masha'Allah, glowing, pure white color...

346
00:52:00.222 --> 00:52:09.109
A shawl on the shoulder - then a light-colored skull cap, slightly off-white, he would sometimes wear a pocket vest with a chain

347
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:12.580
and the chain would be in his pocket with a watch.

348
00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:19.245
In his blessed hand a walking stick - the walking stick would reach up to here, up to the waist.

349
00:52:19.245 --> 00:52:28.760
And even his manner of walking was such - neither fast nor slow - with measured pace he would walk, and while walking he wouldn't talk...

350
00:52:28.943 --> 00:52:38.195
When walking, just silent. He wouldn't talk while standing. When leaving the house, walking, then walk. This was his manner.

351
00:52:38.195 --> 00:52:48.417
And what more can I tell you about what he was like, how he was - like the flower forgot the garden... Just those who have seen can tell.

352
00:52:48.417 --> 00:52:58.865
Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji, Alhamdulillah - those who were born from the same mother - the elder was Pir Haidar Shah Sahib, the younger was Pir...

353
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.276
But during this time, your mother passed away.

354
00:53:03.276 --> 00:53:11.769
And Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji, the one with the black shawl, Sarkar made a second marriage from Muzaffarabad.

355
00:53:11.769 --> 00:53:17.812
That Mai Sabiha - from her came one son. That Mai Sabiha also passed away.

356
00:53:17.812 --> 00:53:25.899
Even before - my father Mian Ghulam Rasool Sahib also married into that family from Muzaffarabad...

357
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:30.905
So the place is called Barmala. What is the place called? Barmala.

358
00:53:30.905 --> 00:53:39.010
We have cousins there - our family from Muzaffarabad, they are our cousins., We have marriages with them - those from Muzaffarabad

359
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:47.551
or those from Gari Dopatta, or those from Baghla Saidaan - so those who were stepbrothers, their blessed name was Baba Ji Pir Sarwar Shah

360
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:49.423
may Allah's mercy be upon him.

361
00:53:49.622 --> 00:53:58.552
Meaning in terms of age, they were younger, the youngest in fact. But still, they were also revered descendants., We have seen them

362
00:53:58.552 --> 00:54:07.346
and it was never apparent - meaning, there was such a bond that no one would ever notice - their faces showed they were brothers.

363
00:54:07.346 --> 00:54:14.231
Sitting together, no one could tell that their mothers were different. But very few people knew this.

364
00:54:14.231 --> 00:54:19.072
They too, Masha'Allah, were beautiful, handsome, and of good character.

365
00:54:20.149 --> 00:54:31.506
What was Sarkar's blessed age when you passed away? You yourself said somewhere that you were around 125 years old.

366
00:54:31.506 --> 00:54:38.616
But the amazing thing is - till death, no glasses were worn. No glasses.

367
00:54:38.616 --> 00:54:48.789
And never said "what, what did you say, I can't hear." And the bedding was such - a small wooden cot...

368
00:54:49.528 --> 00:54:57.444
A small door, an old table from the old times would be there, and on it Hadith books would be lying.

369
00:54:57.444 --> 00:55:03.302
The Mishkat Sharif would be lying, sometimes other books would be lying...

370
00:55:07.905 --> 00:55:36.174
Continuing with devotional practices and daily routine...

371
00:55:37.588 --> 00:55:43.798
First was Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Roshan Shah Sahib, Roshan Deen Ji Sahib - your uncle.

372
00:55:43.798 --> 00:55:49.023
He passed away - a very handsome young man, passed away in his youth.

373
00:55:49.023 --> 00:55:58.719
Now our tradition here is that women's graves are separate, men's graves are separate. Pir Roshan Shah Sahib's grave is there...

374
00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:07.729
And that grave - after that Pir Sarwar Shah Sahib Baba Ji - their blessed grave is at the shrine at Barmala Sharif.

375
00:56:07.729 --> 00:56:14.993
After that, when Dada Ji Sahib passed away within a year, Baba Ji Zarif Ali Sarkar - their grave was made next to theirs.

376
00:56:14.993 --> 00:56:21.297
About a year later, Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib also passed away, next to them - then their burial took place.

377
00:56:21.297 --> 00:56:28.503
This is all, nothing special about it - just that wherever the space was in the shrine, that's where it is. SubhanAllah.
