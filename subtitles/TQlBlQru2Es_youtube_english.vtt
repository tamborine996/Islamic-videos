1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.480
Now I will humbly request in the blessed presence of Hazrat Qibla Pir Syed Muhammad Shabbir Ali Shah Sahib Gilani

2
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.360
that you quench the thirst of our hearts and enlighten us about the life of Hazrat Baba Ali Sahib

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.279
illuminate our hearts and minds. Nara-e-Takbeer!

4
00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.600
Allahu Akbar! Nara-e-Risalat!

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.920
Ya Rasool Allah! Nara-e-Takbeer!

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.840
Allahu Akbar! Nara-e-Risalat!

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.079
Ya Rasool Allah! Long live Astana Aaliya Chura Sharif!

8
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.440
We praise Him and send blessings upon His Noble Messenger. After that, I seek refuge in Allah the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, the Most Noble

9
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.840
from Satan the accursed. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious

10
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.719
the Most Merciful. First of all, I...

11
00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:58.399
this dignified and simple ceremony, in the series of interviews

12
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.799
questions and answers, in this connection these young people

13
00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.920
Website Chura Sharif organized this

14
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.320
Subhan Allah! And

15
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.560
I also pray that may Allah keep this series of theirs going and continuing

16
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.880
Ameen. The personality about whom this interview is being conducted today

17
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.079
questions and answers are being asked

18
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.520
their status, their greatness, their glory

19
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.640
The purpose is simply this - that by describing their greatness and glory, we want to enlighten our hearts

20
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.360
and minds. Subhan Allah!

21
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.079
Since I have often mentioned before

22
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:13.920
that Darbar Aaliya Chura Sharif is a center, a capital of the exalted Naqshbandiyya Mujaddidiyya order

23
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.280
from which thousands and millions of people have benefited

24
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.440
Subhan Allah! They will continue to benefit

25
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440
Subhan Allah! They are benefiting now

26
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.800
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Today anyone who has any connection with Sufism

27
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.959
or who holds love for the Sufis in their heart

28
00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:49.519
whoever belongs to any spiritual order, whoever is a servant of any saint

29
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.680
whoever follows a Sufi, I will say with great confidence

30
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.360
that when Chura Sharif's name is mentioned, when its discussion begins

31
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.879
there cannot be any scholar, any Sufi, anyone connected to Sufism who is unaware of Chura Sharif

32
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.319
Subhan Allah!

33
00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.720
More than a century has passed since Chura Sharif was established

34
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.879
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! And this chain continues till today - the blessings of Naqshbandiyya Mujaddidiyya are being distributed

35
00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.920
This is not mere talk, I am not just speaking empty words

36
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.519
The sun has come - the evidence of the sun itself

37
00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:50.799
That Baba Ji, the crown of Chura Sharif, your blessed progeny

38
00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:59.120
our forefathers have blessed millions - this is not just something to write or speak about

39
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.480
This is not limited to words - look at that time, all of India

40
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.640
that era, from Afghanistan

41
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.759
to the four corners of the world, especially to Hindustan, to Iran

42
00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:27.280
to Syria and Turkey - this chain of blessings that Baba Ji Sahib or his servants and devotees

43
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.440
the devotees have spread. Subhan Allah!

44
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.680
Subhan Allah! But there was a difficulty - since the circumstances were such

45
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.320
which I will briefly mention

46
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.440
that at that time, confronting the government was not an easy task

47
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.400
But the Mujaddidi traditions were kept alive and that invitation letter

48
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:05.759
either accept the government's authority or become a migrant. They did not accept the government's authority

49
00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:13.280
The government at that time was non-Muslim. They did not submit to the government. Otherwise

50
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.039
thousands of people of that era accepted their authority, who today are playing among thousands and millions

51
00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.160
Subhan Allah!

52
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.320
But Baba Ji, the crown of Chura Sharif, declared that I am a beggar at the door of Mustafa

53
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.440
Allahu Akbar! I have no greater inheritance than this

54
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.479
And if I have any inheritance, it is this torn mat of mine

55
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.840
This blanket on my shoulder, this old cloth, and this water pot of mine

56
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.800
No one can take this away from me

57
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.280
But I will speak only that which pleases Allah and His Messenger

58
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.600
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Now another difficulty was that at that time

59
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:11.360
there was no special media era. There was no written tradition either

60
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.199
But when written documentation began, even that was not sufficient to quench people's thirst

61
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:26.240
And the sad truth is, and all friends will agree

62
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.120
that those who had the right, in my opinion, did not fulfill their duty either. They kept working in their own way

63
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.680
But Alhamdulillah, Baba Ji Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi, Lord of the Worlds

64
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:47.600
Hazoor Baba Ji Pir Syed Noor Muhammad Gilani Rahmatullah Alayhi's name was bright then, is bright now, and will remain bright until the morning of Judgment Day

65
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.840
Hazoor Qibla Alam Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah

66
00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:06.800
known as Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar - they are asking about this personality who was a living example of his predecessors

67
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.800
Consider him a picture of the pure Shariah

68
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.080
Consider him a treasure of love for Mustafa

69
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.440
Subhan Allah! On whose lips always

70
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.840
either the support of Quran or the lesson of the life of Mustafa Kareem would be present

71
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.199
Subhan Allah! I will explain further ahead

72
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:43.440
Since there was no media era. This was a worn and weary caravan. It started from Baghdad. It stopped at various places

73
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:52.160
It reached Bukhara. From there, moving forward, this worn caravan, giving lessons of truth, reached the Kurram Agency area of Tirah

74
00:07:52.160 --> 00:08:00.560
Stayed there, then this caravan moved again to North Waziristan, stopped at Akhan Kot

75
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:08.639
From there, this caravan of three or two people moved on. One brother stayed in Tirah Sharif

76
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:16.800
The younger brother, there is a place on the Kohat to Bannu road called Darsamand

77
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.680
Darsamand - this is a common invitation. They settled in Darsamand

78
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.240
Their descendants are still there today. The Sadat Gilani of Darsamand are our paternal cousins

79
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:35.599
Subhan Allah! A single person, this caravan consisted of four people. First, in 1867 or 68, Chura Sharif was settled

80
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:53.120
Camp was set up. Great difficulties and hardships were endured. But the word of truth was never abandoned

81
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.160
Subhan Allah!

82
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.480
They did not care for worldly property. Hundreds of

83
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:10.160
lands and estates were sent on golden trays saying just speak one word - accept our authority

84
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:16.720
This was at the time when the present district Attock of Chura Sharif did not exist

85
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.360
At that time the district was headquartered at Shahpur

86
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:29.519
This was at that time. But they said no, these estates, these lands mean nothing to me compared to a single piece from the door of Mustafa

87
00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:35.839
Subhan Allah! As Ala Hazrat said - do not fall at the feet of strangers for their scraps

88
00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:46.320
Hazoor Qibla Ala Baba Ji, the story will be long. Pir Haider Shah Badshah, as we have heard - since there is no written record as I said

89
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:56.480
his birth was in Tirah Sharif. Subhan Allah! He was born in Tirah Sharif

90
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:04.000
The chain continued there but these are travelers of another caravan. The first caravan that settled Chura Sharif, they are not from that caravan

91
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.040
They are from the second or third caravan that culminated, they came to Darbar Chura Sharif in that caravan

92
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:23.360
This was the chain of his birth. Now, Allah knows the truth of what we have heard or seen and read

93
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.839
Who proposed his name? Who gave him the title?

94
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:42.160
Subhan Allah! We heard from the elders

95
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.560
that his blessed birth

96
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:55.120
was in Tirah Sharif. The name that was proposed, it was by his grandfather

97
00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.279
Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Faqir Muhammad Rahmatullah Alayhi who proposed it

98
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:04.399
He proposed the name

99
00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:10.640
The first haircut was also given by Hazrat's own hands

100
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.480
Subhan Allah! After giving the haircut, he raised his hands in prayer

101
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.320
saying O my Lord, this prince grandson you have blessed me with, my Lord, I have named him Haider Shah

102
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.160
I have connected his lineage to Maula Murtaza Haider Karrar

103
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.000
Subhan Allah! My Lord, honor the name I have given

104
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:42.640
and honor my prayer, and may he possess those qualities that Sarkar Maula Murtaza Haider Karrar had. This was the chain of naming

105
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:50.320
Subhan Allah! Now about his childhood

106
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.399
His brother who was an elder

107
00:11:54.399 --> 00:12:05.519
I heard from him just one or two things. First was that from childhood, as is the way of the Sufis

108
00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:12.959
from childhood there was a chain of piety

109
00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:17.440
there was a chain of God-consciousness

110
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.160
staying away from frivolous talk or any sports and games of that time

111
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:38.320
And I have also heard that those who were his peers, same age companions, he would tell them even in childhood

112
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.560
that brother, we have not come to this world for play and games, to waste our time in games

113
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.240
We have come to this world to do some work. Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah!

114
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:02.560
And we have to do work in this world. So I have heard that his peers would say

115
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.959
what work do we have to do, brother, tell us. He would say the greatest work is that we have to spread the word of truth to the people

116
00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:17.440
and my father's teachings - I have to spread them. Subhan Allah!

117
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.480
This is what I heard. Subhan Allah!

118
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:27.920
These are the childhood circumstances. What else, how else - only Allah knows best

119
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:35.160
These two things I heard, I have presented. Where did he get his early education

120
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.440
and who was among his teachers

121
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:48.480
Just like, from today, some time ago

122
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.040
before

123
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.199
this, in our

124
00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:06.399
elders' and ancestors' homes, this tradition continued that early education was given at home

125
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:13.600
It was given at home because that era was such

126
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:20.720
that the pearls of knowledge distributed at home were very deep and precious

127
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:29.680
And in obtaining education, Baba Ji Sarkar's elders, so early education was from his father

128
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:39.680
and his paternal uncle Hazoor who was a leading scholar of that time

129
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:53.199
a genius of his era, whose blessed name was Hazrat Baba Ji Muhammad Syed Muhammad Gul Nabi Shah Rahmatullah Alayhi

130
00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:55.040
Subhan Allah!

131
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:11.199
He was his paternal uncle who was running the chain of education at that time. Then there was grandfather's education too

132
00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:16.880
His grandfather Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Faqir Pir Muhammad Rahmatullah Alayhi who was the elder brother

133
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:24.800
From the land of Afghanistan to the land of Hindustan, he was called Mulla Ji

134
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:34.000
Since only in Pakistan and India, or perhaps Bangladesh, East Pakistan - this word Mufti is used

135
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.360
but in Afghanistan and other matters, the word Mulla was used. Mulla meant a person of piety, a person of knowledge

136
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:47.360
and one who has enough knowledge to give a fatwa. And Hazrat's great grandfather

137
00:15:47.360 --> 00:16:03.279
His blessed name was Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Deen Muhammad Shah Rahmatullah Alayhi, known as Hazrat Mulla Ji Sahib

138
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:10.560
I have also heard that some benefit was taken from him too, since they had established a proper school here at Chura Sharif

139
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:21.360
where their progeny and family members were taught. That was the chain of education at that time

140
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.920
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Now this question is about the name Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah Sahib Badshah

141
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:28.639
what comes with it - Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar. I have heard

142
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:34.240
that his brothers who were his contemporaries at that time

143
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:42.000
in some gathering his elders, grandfather and uncle

144
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.400
mentioned something about the Prophet, the Pride of all Creation

145
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:56.720
the Noble Master, the Beloved, peace be upon him, his blessed shawl

146
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:05.679
the black shawl, the black blanket. It settled so deeply in his heart

147
00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:13.039
that from childhood to youth, from youth till the end, he took black cloth, made it into a shawl

148
00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:21.200
and started keeping it not on the right but on the left shoulder, according to the Sunnah. Subhan Allah!

149
00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:32.400
And when someone asked about this black shawl, Sarkar said my Master used a black blanket

150
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.720
so I say this is my Master's Sunnah. Subhan Allah!

151
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.640
May this tradition also continue. Subhan Allah!

152
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.480
And then that black shawl became such a part of life

153
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:52.240
that he became famous for it. In Chura Sharif, his brothers and elders

154
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:58.480
made him famous saying Haider Shah Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar

155
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.240
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Even today in Chura Sharif if someone says Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar

156
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.760
everyone understands. The youth of our family, my brothers, elders even now understand

157
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.559
that Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar means Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi

158
00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:16.960
This was the chain of the black shawl. Alhamdulillah

159
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.600
Now the word Badshah - there are two meanings. One is humorous - someone who is carefree, detached

160
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:30.480
is called Badshah. Another meaning is when someone has kingly qualities, they are called Badshah

161
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:41.520
Now his state of indifference was such

162
00:18:41.520 --> 00:19:07.520
and his state of absorption was such, his closeness to Allah and the Prophet was such that whoever came, big or small, sat down, left, greetings were exchanged, well-being was asked, and that was all

163
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:12.400
After that, his royal demeanor was such that

164
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:20.480
he wore very fine clothing his entire life. He used elegant attire

165
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:29.039
He used a beautiful waistcoat. So this relationship was also bestowed from his family

166
00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:40.400
His elders would say this son of ours is a king. Subhan Allah!

167
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.919
He is a king. Subhan Allah!

168
00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:43.600
He is a king. Subhan Allah!

169
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.840
So in this regard, this title or honor, whatever you may call it

170
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:56.559
Haider Shah Badshah - this word was used. But in the world of Sufism

171
00:19:56.559 --> 00:20:03.679
those who were his contemporaries, I don't know about them. But I will note the reference of Kasur

172
00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:10.240
Many people in England are witnesses to this. In Kasur there was a great saint of the Chishti order

173
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:17.280
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Syed Naqeeb Ullah Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi

174
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.559
A reliable companion told me this

175
00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:27.039
that in his gathering, there was mention of Hazoor Baba Ji Qibla Alam Pir Syed Naqeeb Ullah Shah Sahib

176
00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:34.240
He was a great Sufi, a great scholar, not ordinary at all. He was a high-ranking

177
00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:43.919
scholar and at that time, the sign of a Pir was that they were great scholars. Subhan Allah!

178
00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:45.280
Subhan Allah!

179
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.880
Among them was Hazrat Baba Ji Sayyidna Naqeeb Ullah Shah Sahib, a perfect Sufi

180
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.840
When his gathering started discussing leisurely, he paid attention and asked whose mention is this

181
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:06.240
A servant said it's about Chura Sharif. Then in a state of spiritual ecstasy, friends who were his servants here tell us

182
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:13.360
that in a strange spiritual state, he said the one you are mentioning, Pir Haider Shah Sahib - he was a king of spiritual path

183
00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:23.120
Subhan Allah!

184
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:29.679
He was the king of the spiritual path. This is no ordinary thing. So this also happened that his peers and contemporaries

185
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:36.159
and those after him, the people of Sufism, people of insight, they would acknowledge that he wanted the spiritual path

186
00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:41.760
In the name of Allah. This is a tradition that comes in our family, and is in most families

187
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:49.039
that the family's pledge is within the family. Now whose hand is the pledge on? A person of wisdom understands

188
00:21:49.039 --> 00:22:04.080
Like my sons, their pledge is to their paternal grandfather's younger brother Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Muhammad Ali Shah Sarkar's blessed hand

189
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:11.440
The youngest wasn't there at that time, but Usman Shah, Fazl Usman Shah, Fazl Noman Shah's pledge is on his hand

190
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:23.360
In this way, this chain continues till today. Pledges also happen outside, like my nephews - may Allah grant them safety

191
00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:40.400
Both or three nephews' pledge is to Hazrat Baba Ji Sarkar Sirhindi Sarkar, probably Muhammad Masum - not Sarhad, Madani

192
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:47.120
He was in Madinah Munawwarah. Both their pledges are on his hand. In this way

193
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.440
there are other young men of ours whose pledges are outside. But Alhamdulillah, in the Mujaddidiyya and Naqshbandiyya order

194
00:22:53.440 --> 00:23:00.480
as I have come to know from somewhere that some youth had an inclination towards Hazrat Sarkar Baba Ji Muhammad Fazl Usman Jan Sirhindi

195
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:08.720
their eagerness was towards him. Similarly, Hazrat Baba Ji Sarkar Syed Haider Shah Badshah, Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar's pledge

196
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:16.240
was on his grandfather's hand, whom the world of Sufism knows as Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Faqir Muhammad Rahmatullah Alayhi

197
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:22.559
Subhan Allah! The Khilafats (spiritual successions) he had - he had two Khilafats

198
00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:28.000
One Khilafat was bestowed from his grandfather, and the second Khilafat was from his father

199
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.799
Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Ahmad Nabi, known as Zulfan Wali Sarkar

200
00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:40.240
He would lovingly mention that I have served two kings and from two emperors I have obtained this chain

201
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.360
Subhan Allah!

202
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.600
Masha Allah, this is a beautiful question. Since Hazrat's passing was in 64

203
00:23:47.600 --> 00:24:07.360
In 64, at that time I was studying at Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia. But from Chura Sharif at that time

204
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:28.880
his spiritual retreat was at Dhok Mithi Sharif. I would present myself in his service whenever I was free

205
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.279
This was before going to Lahore and after. During my student days, it was my good fortune that Sarkar asked

206
00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:41.960
what do you do, where are you? I submitted that Sarkar, I am in Lahore. What do you do? I said I study

207
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:48.720
Where do you study? What do you study? I said Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia. He said I know, I know Mufti Muhammad Hussain Naeemi Sahib

208
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:55.080
I said he is among our teachers. He teaches and there are other teaching faculty too

209
00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:10.640
After a silence, he told me that sometimes take out time and visit Data Ganj Bakhsh Ali Hujwiri. Subhan Allah!

210
00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:23.760
Don't be proud of sitting at the head, sit at the feet. Subhan Allah!

211
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.080
And after finishing there, sometimes also visit Allama Iqbal, the Qalandar of Lahore. He will also give you something

212
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.600
Subhan Allah! This was one chain. Then I started going. There's a tradition in Lahore

213
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.159
that on Thursdays we must go to Data Sahib, and while passing, we visit Allama Iqbal Rahmatullah Alayhi

214
00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:46.880
The term Lahori Qalandar was used by Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah Rahmatullah Alayhi first. If anyone else claims it, I have no concern

215
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.000
Then I would go there. Now let me tell you something interesting

216
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.520
Two miracles of Allama Iqbal Sahib I will mention that I have seen practically, not just heard

217
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.480
The first was in 60... or 66

218
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:14.960
I was traveling from Daska and was on a bus. On the way there is a beautiful turn called Nandipur where there's a power station

219
00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:25.679
When we reached there, a cool breeze blew. It was summer season. A thought came to my mind

220
00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:31.520
that I have such love and devotion for Allama Iqbal Rahmatullah Alayhi but he has never guided me till today

221
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.279
I thought just this and my eyes closed. When I dozed off, I saw Allama Sahib standing next to me in the bus

222
00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:46.240
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! He placed his hand on my shoulder and said you have complained, so open this notebook

223
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.720
I had a book in my hand, it was a student custom then. Whatever was liked was written down

224
00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:56.240
The teachers would say the same. Whatever was liked, I wrote it. There were also folk songs that I liked

225
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:61.520
Many verses were written on vehicles that were liked. There was always a pen with me

226
00:26:61.520 --> 00:27:10.960
Then Allama Rahmatullah Alayhi, Lahori Qalandar, said you have complained, so write now. What did he make me write?

227
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:17.200
He ordered me to write: This lesson I have learned from Lahori Qalandar. Subhan Allah!

228
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:14.240
This lesson I have learned from Lahori Qalandar - Being a beggar of Mustafa is better than being Alexander of the world

229
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:21.760
Subhan Allah! Allah, this he made me note down, I noted it. And when the bus jolted, I looked, it was written there but Hazrat was not there

230
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.679
Subhan Allah!

231
00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:29.679
After that, since Hazrat had instructed to keep visiting Allama Iqbal

232
00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:37.919
they will give you something from there. Then once I complained that there are only two or three Naats explicitly titled in your work

233
00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:44.159
You haven't written a Naat with a specific title. So in a dream, Hazrat Allama Lahori Qalandar told me

234
00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:52.640
that I have written one Naat which has not been destroyed but is lying in my library. The first verse of that Naat is:

235
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:58.080
The eye of the lover perceives the semi-veil. No matter how much he hides his face in Taiba

236
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:04.320
hiding it a thousand times. Now regarding training, I would often reach Hazrat's service

237
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.960
From there, book learning was less but practical learning was abundant. Subhan Allah!

238
00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:28.320
What was practical learning? Like, I won't attribute this to him, but Azam Lahori has a verse in his Naat

239
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:34.240
He sits on a mat but is enthroned on the heavens. From there practically, I learned a lesson

240
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.919
That practical lesson was that despite having everything, one must keep oneself humble and modest

241
00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:46.320
Not boast. Practically, this is what was learned there. And as for training, Alhamdulillah whatever is there, it is the blessing of Sarkar's gaze

242
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:56.240
Subhan Allah! Beautiful moments - each and every moment was beautiful, more beautiful. But in my conscious life

243
00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:04.799
there are many beautiful moments. That time was also beautiful. Today I recall that mats are spread

244
00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:13.039
and the king of Chura Sharif is seated. Subhan Allah! Hazoor Baba Ji is present

245
00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:21.440
My respected father is present. Hazoor Qibla Chacha Ji (paternal uncle) is present. Grandfather's younger brother

246
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:27.279
Hazoor Qibla Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib is present. And his maternal cousin, grandfather who was a great leading scholar of his time

247
00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:33.120
a very great leading scholar. His blessed name was Hazoor Qibla Alam Baba Ji Pir Syed Maulana Saeed Ahmad Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi

248
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:40.559
who was a maternal cousin, is seated. And then others including his other maternal cousins

249
00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:54.159
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Syed Muhammad Shafi Rahmatullah Alayhi. And they are

250
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.919
discussing something amongst themselves. The discussion is about a well in the mosque

251
00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:11.919
whether drinking water from it is permissible or not. This discussion was going on

252
00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:19.279
It was a beautiful moment. Very heated questions and answers were happening

253
00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:25.360
And in this Q&A, what did Baba Ji say? He said my teacher - he didn't say which one

254
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.799
had said that if the well is endowed for the mosque, then its water is not for the general public but for the worshippers

255
00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:36.640
If it's general, then the public can take water from it. Now this well is in the mosque

256
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.960
They said build a small wall and put it outside the mosque's corner, so people can also drink

257
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.039
That was a beautiful moment. It was my childhood and those brothers, Masha Allah, were engaged in heated discussions

258
00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:51.679
Similarly, I remember one phrase about this mourning food we cook in Pakistan

259
00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:56.320
In our area we call it Khairat. The mourning food that's cooked. In our Azad Kashmir too

260
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:61.760
I don't remember much. Just that someone said is it permissible or not? Some discussion was going on

261
00:31:61.760 --> 00:32:07.039
Baba Ji smiled and said to Maulana Mian Saeed Shah Sahib - I know this much that mourning food is for travelers

262
00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:11.440
Keep this food as food, don't make it a feast. If you make it a feast, perhaps there won't be a permissible way

263
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.720
But if you make it a necessity, perhaps this matter will resolve. Those were beautiful moments

264
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:28.960
Those beautiful moments are still before me. Sometimes traveling on horseback with a caravan of devotees

265
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:35.039
Sometimes talking about Madinah Tayyibah, tears flowing from eyes. And what Naat was being recited

266
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.519
A Naat was being recited: The cool shadows of your fasts, the cold breezes, O Wearer of the Blanket

267
00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:41.840
This was a Naat. Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah!

268
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.039
And I remember two or three verses of another Naat. What beautiful moments they were

269
00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:51.039
What a strange gathering it was. There were Naat reciters, there was an elder. Since I was a child

270
00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:55.120
I remember till today that Naat which was: Every moment I await, of the Lord of the Black Blanket

271
00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.480
My eyes keep looking towards the paths of the Arabian camel riders

272
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.640
That Naat was being recited. Those were beautiful moments. But since it was childhood

273
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.720
In 64, he passed away. These two or three things are preserved in my mind

274
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.840
Look, the thing is that when Pakistan came into existence, this is a long political question but I'll be brief

275
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:20.240
When it was time to create Pakistan, in India's - if I say 100 percent, it's still correct - 99 percent

276
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:31.599
of the Mashaikh were determined to create Pakistan. Subhan Allah!

277
00:33:31.599 --> 00:33:33.599
And the slogan was: We will create Pakistan. The cry was: We will take Pakistan. Subhan Allah!

278
00:33:33.599 --> 00:34:01.200
In this regard, Hazrat's residence was in Lahore, Wasal Pura, Chowk Piranwala

279
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:09.359
Maulana Muhammad Bakhsh Muslim D Rahmatullah Alayhi was the special advisor to Hazrat Baba Ji Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Quaid-e-Azam

280
00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:16.879
Quaid-e-Azam Sahib said that Muslim Sahib's matter doesn't seem to be working out

281
00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:23.119
What should we do? Muslim Sahib said there is a Pir, an elder who has great influence in politics

282
00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:27.679
The world calls him Pir Jamaat Ali Shah. If he comes under our influence, it would be great

283
00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:39.680
When you went to him - now if anyone denies this, that's their choice, but what Muslim Sahib himself told me

284
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:38.960
He said I am bound by the command of my Sheikh, my Mashaikh. Wherever they guide me, I will go. Subhan Allah!

285
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.560
Now I don't know what permissions were sought. In any case, Pakistan should be created

286
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.320
Muslim Sahib took Muhammad Ali Jinnah and presented himself to Baba Ji in Wasal Pura

287
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:54.880
He came with a message. Baba Ji said tomorrow. The next day he summoned Amir-e-Millat

288
00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:02.000
Hazrat Hafiz Ji Rahmatullah Alayhi came to him. He said Jamaat Ali Shah, I command you

289
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.560
to start a nationwide movement and go out with the flag of Pakistan. Allah will make you successful

290
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.320
Subhan Allah! Then Hazrat Amir-e-Millat submitted: Hazrat, if Pakistan is created, I will go out

291
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:20.480
If it's not created, what will happen? Sarkar said: Jamaat Ali Shah, this has been approved from the Court above

292
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.760
Subhan Allah! This has been approved from the Court above

293
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.560
Subhan Allah! In any case, the country will be created and the credit will go to Quaid-e-Azam

294
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.359
Subhan Allah!

295
00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:32.839
Pir Jamaat Ali Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi would say that when I received this order from the Pir Khana

296
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:38.720
he would say in Punjabi: Oh brother, my liver became cold, my liver became satisfied

297
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.680
that I got the confirmation, I was certain I would create Pakistan

298
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:49.280
And then after that, the fatwa that was issued - the truth should be told

299
00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:55.359
The fatwa that was issued from Kuchocha Sharif - the present Hashmi Mian Sahib, their grandfather

300
00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:59.760
issued the fatwa. Samja Hasan Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi, Muhaddith Kuchochvi

301
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.480
The fatwa was that a Muslim who doesn't vote for Muslim League, if he dies, don't bury him in a Muslim cemetery

302
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.359
This was a very sensitive and strict fatwa. And this fatwa was verified by Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah

303
00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:13.760
who said the fatwa from Kuchocha Sharif is absolutely correct. Hold it and go out. Allah will make you successful

304
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.640
Subhan Allah!

305
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.760
Many religious institutions are established. The institutions named Jamia Haideria

306
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.119
You also have Jamia Haideria running. And Alhamdulillah there's one in Chura Sharif

307
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:32.320
in Lahore too, in Rawalpindi too there's an institution running

308
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:38.560
In Peer Badai near Fauji Colony, Alhamdulillah Jamia Haideria Mujaddidiyya is running

309
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:45.520
Similarly locally one is running in Mithi Sharif too, Jamia Haideria. In Lahore too. Then in Hanjer Rayald

310
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.880
near Gujranwala, there too. Many institutions are attributed to Baba Ji's name

311
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.119
Because whatever we get is the charity and blessing of your name

312
00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:58.720
And it's our duty as servants that wherever we establish an institution, we attribute it to Hazrat's name

313
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:04.079
Subhan Allah! As for patronage, in Lahore, since part of his life was spent there

314
00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:11.359
He greatly patronized Ahzab ul Anaf, patronized Jamia Naemania

315
00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:18.320
And as for mosques, he had many mosques built

316
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.040
Many mosques were built, he left imams there and took their salary and maintenance upon himself

317
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:28.240
saying your only duty is to lead prayers and teach children the Quran. Subhan Allah!

318
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.880
Teach the Quran, teach Hadith

319
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:36.640
But after that, if any representative of any school came to him in any matter, he wouldn't send them empty-handed

320
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:44.079
He would always bestow something, patronize them. We have many proofs of where all he patronized

321
00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:50.000
Even in Makkah Mukarramah, there was a school, its name was Salafiyya, Jamia Salafiyya

322
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.760
But at that time it wasn't made into a particular sect. We have correspondence from there too

323
00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:62.480
that Sarkar used to patronize them too. And during that time, there was also a school in Madinah Tayyibah

324
00:37:62.480 --> 00:38:00.880
which he patronized and sent his share there

325
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.079
And after that, in Jamia Mujaddidiyya Sirhind Sharif, on top of Hazrat Mujaddid Pak's Khanqah

326
00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:08.960
the school that was established, at that time Sarkar used to patronize that too

327
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:15.440
And annually he would send them cash and would say with great joy

328
00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:18.720
Brothers, all the charity we receive is due to Hazrat Mujaddid Pak's blessing

329
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:24.079
so why shouldn't we serve wholeheartedly? Subhan Allah!

330
00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:30.880
But you cannot even imagine how strict was the adherence to Shariah

331
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:38.000
The adherence to Shariah was such that even in gatherings no one could do anything wrong

332
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.839
I remember a religious scholar came - I won't mention his name - he had tied

333
00:38:43.839 --> 00:38:50.320
a turban with a very large tassel. Sarkar called him close with affection

334
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:56.800
and said, Maulana, I have read that a small tassel is permissible

335
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:03.280
but keeping such a large one exceeds the limits. Allah!

336
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:11.920
Similarly, even young girls were not allowed to recite Quran loudly

337
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.520
There was restriction on them too. Similarly, I observed that when

338
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.920
Sarkar would put on blessed sandals, he would put the right foot in first

339
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.960
Subhan Allah! And if anyone made a mistake, he would correct them

340
00:39:24.960 --> 00:38:33.680
saying this is not correct, don't do it this way. Even in eating, there was such discipline

341
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.160
that all companions would eat together and he would say, say Bismillah loudly

342
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.359
so that each one can hear the other

343
00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:46.880
And there are many such matters - how many should I enumerate?

344
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:53.280
But it wasn't harsh - there was no strictness. There was a way of explaining

345
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.880
with gentleness, not harshness. He would explain in a unique manner

346
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.680
Two elders from our Azad Kashmir, District Kotli, went to meet him

347
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.240
Let me tell you their names - one was Hazrat Maulana Muhammad Baqir Ali Khan

348
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:14.560
His descendants are all in Bolton. The other who came to meet was Hakim Wilayat Khan

349
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.760
His descendants are also in Bolton. Hakim Wilayat Khan didn't have a beard - he used to shave

350
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.839
And Maulana Baqir Ali Sahib, being a Maulvi, had kept a beard

351
00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:31.920
So Baba Ji Sarkar asked Maulvi Baqir Ali Khan - has it been applied?

352
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.160
He replied yes. Then asked the other one - has it been applied?

353
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:42.480
He said, wait a moment. Allahu Akbar!

354
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.680
Didn't say anything - wait a moment. They sat for one or two minutes

355
00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:53.440
and then Hakim Sahib used to say that much time passed but my wish was

356
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:59.200
that when I present myself at Baba Ji's court, the Sunnah of Mustafa should be on my face

357
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.280
Subhan Allah! This was a practice - once a companion stood up to drink water

358
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.119
Sarkar gestured for him to sit down. When he sat, Sarkar said

359
00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:12.720
My Master the Prophet has said to drink water while sitting

360
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.040
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! So these were many things. And another interesting thing

361
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.760
is that there was a Maulana, his name was Maulana Muhammad Fazl-e-Ilahi Rahmatullah Alayh

362
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:27.359
In Baba Ji's gatherings, his duty was to give lessons in Hadith

363
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:31.119
Subhan Allah! Hazoor himself would listen, the companions would listen too

364
00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:34.400
and when the lesson ended, Hazrat himself would explain it further

365
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.440
And wouldn't say this was wrong - would say this point was missed by Maulana Sahib

366
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.920
Since such things can be missed, it came to my mind so let me complete it

367
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.920
This was the style of teaching with love

368
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.319
The wealth of love for the Prophet - even today, Alhamdulillah, my noble family

369
00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:57.960
is filled to the brim with it. Subhan Allah!

370
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:05.280
Now see, there was a great scholar in Pakistan named Maulana Abdul Ghafoor

371
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.800
Ghazalvi Rahmatullah Alayh, Sheikh-ul-Quran. Masha Allah, Subhan Allah!

372
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.560
He was delivering a sermon and looked around

373
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:19.200
and addressed Zahuri Sahib and Maulana Muhammad Hussain Gulfurosh

374
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:27.680
He said, Brother Gulfurosh, tell Zahuri that here at Chura Sharif, speak very carefully

375
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.480
Here the ocean of love for Mustafa must be navigated carefully

376
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.599
And if I slip slightly, young Sahihzadas are sitting here - don't think them small

377
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:42.480
they will catch me immediately. This is the situation

378
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.000
And I still remember the gathering at Khanqah Chura Sharif

379
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.599
Hazoor Qibla Zia-ul-Ummat Pir Muhammad Karam Shah Al-Azhari

380
00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.640
Subhan Allah! The cultivator of love for Mustafa

381
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.240
Allah! He was speaking and the scene was that

382
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.680
the Sahihzadas were swaying and tears were flowing from their eyes

383
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:06.160
When they stood for Salam and this verse was recited - those whose prostration

384
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:10.079
the mihrab of Kaaba used to bow for

385
00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:13.200
Ask anyone who was there - Pir Karam Shah Azhari also fell into prostration

386
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.680
The Sahihzadas also fell into prostration, and all the people fell into prostration

387
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.560
And the one reciting Salam repeated this verse approximately 18 times

388
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.160
Subhan Allah! And when he stopped, he said, for God's sake

389
00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.960
please raise your heads, I don't understand what to do

390
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:37.200
This wealth of love for the Prophet is common. Even today I say with confidence

391
00:39:37.200 --> 00:43:42.800
that anyone can go to Chura Sharif, take hold of any Sahihzada

392
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.440
and ask them any question - see what happens. And even today our state here is

393
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:53.280
that when the youth gather together - we are the old ones among them

394
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.599
When we sit together, I often tell the Sahihzadas

395
00:43:57.599 --> 00:44:03.119
to recite some Naat. Among them is our Sahihzada Fasih-ud-Din

396
00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:07.599
You understand - he's a very good Naat reciter. And Ali Abbas Shah Sahib

397
00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:13.599
has a beautiful voice. And Hazrat Maulana Allama Sahihzada Muhammad Farooq-ul-Islam

398
00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:17.680
Sahib is a great scholar, a Qazi, and has a wonderful voice

399
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:23.760
and recites beautiful Naat. Similarly among young Sahihzadas, Razi Abbas Sahib

400
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.359
is my cousin - son of my very affectionate uncle

401
00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:33.839
All of them recite Naat together. Just a year ago, we were sitting in the mosque

402
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:37.280
They said to me, Brother, you're sitting quietly. I said my health isn't good

403
00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:42.000
so create some atmosphere. They said we'll create it right now

404
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.640
And they created such an atmosphere - three of them sat together and started reciting Naat

405
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.960
And that Naat was - we were sitting inside Baba Ji's mosque

406
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.359
The Naat was: The river of Your mercy flows openly

407
00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:58.480
Subhan Allah! I'm receiving alms, my work is progressing

408
00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.119
Subhan Allah! Your name is above the Throne, Your name is everywhere

409
00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:07.839
And when they reached the final verse

410
00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:14.160
that whatever I have is the charity of Mustafa, this slave lives on Your scraps

411
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:19.359
All the Sahihzadas sitting in the mosque - screams and wails could be heard

412
00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:23.280
Alhamdulillah, the wealth of love for Mustafa was being distributed then

413
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:29.040
and even today it is being distributed. Every young person, Alhamdulillah

414
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:35.440
you will find is practicing religion with love for Mustafa Karim in their heart

415
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:41.040
And especially in this era when great people are wavering

416
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.200
Sahihzadas are wavering - but I say with pride that my Baba Ji's descendants

417
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:50.560
the youth, even today in matters of creed are so firm and steadfast

418
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.720
that no one can shake them or challenge them

419
00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:00.319
The state of love for Mustafa is such that wherever you go - Ramadan in Madinah Munawwarah

420
00:46:00.319 --> 00:46:04.480
Alhamdulillah, Chura Sharif is being represented. Go for Hajj

421
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.760
Chura Sharif is being represented. All the youth, Masha Allah

422
00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.960
the apple of my Baba Ji's eyes, my Baba Ji's pure progeny, Alhamdulillah

423
00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:19.200
each one better than the other is spreading this wealth of love

424
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.960
At that time there were ships - steamers they called them

425
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.520
Ships departed from Bombay - that was the port for all India

426
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:38.480
There were multiple attendances. Hajj at that time wasn't easy - it took 3-4 months

427
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.720
Even going for Hajj took 3-4 months. So there were multiple attendances

428
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:47.280
I don't have exact numbers but there were many blessed attendances

429
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.960
of Baba Ji Sahib in Madinah Tayyibah. Subhan Allah!

430
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:57.680
This is also a good question. The elders of that time, those who were peers of his

431
00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:02.800
after hearing this, each would teach their own spiritual path

432
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:07.920
For example, I'll mention Golra Sharif as a reference

433
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.319
It's a sad thing today that there's a strange jealousy in hearts

434
00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:17.599
People don't even like to mention others' names. We weren't taught this

435
00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:22.160
We were taught that one who is miserly can never become a Faqir

436
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.160
He can never become a Sufi - one who is miserly. Indeed! Subhan Allah!

437
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.520
So with great confidence, Alhamdulillah, we mention the Sufis

438
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:37.760
and refresh our faith. Darbar Aaliya Golra Sharif is a great Khanqah of Chishti order

439
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.800
And on their pulpit, two books were always present

440
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:49.839
One was Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi's Fusus al-Hikam and one was Masnavi Sharif

441
00:47:49.839 --> 00:47:51.119
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Mehr Ali Shah would regularly teach these. Subhan Allah!

442
00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:57.119
Lessons would be held. Similarly in our Khwajagan tradition

443
00:47:57.119 --> 00:48:04.800
especially Baba Ji Sahib would regularly at night quote from Maktubat Sharif

444
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:10.480
of Hazrat Mujaddid Pak and speak. The phrase would be: My Imam Rabbani has said this

445
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.880
My Imam Rabbani has said this. Allahu Akbar!

446
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:19.280
This tradition continued - almost daily after Maghrib prayers

447
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:25.599
this practice would continue. The phrase was always: My Imam Rabbani has said this

448
00:48:25.599 --> 00:48:31.119
And he would often say, read Maktubat Sharif

449
00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:34.559
embrace it and derive benefit from it. Subhan Allah!

450
00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:42.000
The blessed gathering - how do I describe it? Just understand it was like several suns

451
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.480
several moons. Subhan Allah! White face. Subhan Allah!

452
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:51.280
And on the head, a white blessed turban. Subhan Allah!

453
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:58.079
On the shoulders, a black shawl. Locks flowing

454
00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:01.760
As Riaz-ud-Din Sahib has a verse of Naat

455
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:08.880
I'm not attributing it to them, it's a Naat verse

456
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.559
about the blessed locks swaying, displaying the glory of the Prophet

457
00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:18.880
Swaying locks demonstrating the honor of the Trustworthy One

458
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:24.880
I don't know if this Naat is recited anymore - Riaz-ud-Din Sordi Sahib recited it to me

459
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.200
in Madinah Pak 20-25 years ago. So the locks, white blessed beard

460
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:36.400
practicing Shariah, Masha Allah! Good height, reddish complexion

461
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:45.440
shawl on shoulders of light pearl color. Sometimes white Boski coat with a chain

462
00:39:45.440 --> 00:49:50.319
and in the pocket a watch. Blessed staff in hand

463
00:49:50.319 --> 00:49:56.079
The staff would come up to here - to the waist. And the walking style

464
00:49:56.079 --> 00:50:02.559
was neither fast nor slow - moderate. And not in the habit of talking while walking

465
00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:07.760
When walking, walk silently. Don't talk while standing

466
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.240
When you start walking, just walk. This was the style. What more can I tell you

467
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:16.800
what he was like, how he was. That blessed sight is now forgotten. Subhan Allah!

468
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.680
Only those who saw him can describe. Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji Sahib Rahmatullah Alayh

469
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:32.079
From one mother's lineage, the eldest was Pir Haider Shah Sahib

470
00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:36.240
The younger one was Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib

471
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.520
Younger than them was Pir Roshan Shah Sahib

472
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:46.000
But during this time, Hazoor's mother passed away and Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji

473
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:54.559
Zulfan Wali Sarkar married a second time from Muzaffarabad

474
00:50:54.559 --> 00:51:00.480
From that Mai Sahiba, one son was born. She also passed away

475
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:05.359
That son - Mian Ghulam Rasool Sahib from Muzaffarabad

476
00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:09.599
was also Speaker of Assembly. The place is called Barmala

477
00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:13.119
Barmala - our cousin family still lives there

478
00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:17.680
These Muzaffarabad Gilanis are our cousin family - we have relations with them

479
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:23.040
whether from Muzaffarabad, or Garhi Dupatta, or Bangla Saidaan

480
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.040
That Sahihzada's blessed name was Baba Ji Pir Sarwar Shah Rahmatullah Alayh

481
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:32.880
meaning age-wise he was the youngest of all

482
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:38.240
But since he was also a Sahihzada, I've seen him and it didn't feel different

483
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:43.440
The atmosphere was such that no one felt different. Their appearance

484
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.240
showed they were brothers. Very few people knew their mothers were different

485
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.520
He was also Masha Allah very handsome and beautiful

486
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.839
and worth seeing. Subhan Allah!

487
00:51:57.839 --> 00:52:02.720
Sarkar's blessed age - when he passed away

488
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:11.280
he himself had mentioned somewhere that his age was around 125 years

489
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:14.800
Subhan Allah! But the amazing thing was

490
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.119
that he never wore glasses his entire life. Subhan Allah!

491
00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:22.880
Never wore glasses and never said that he couldn't hear properly

492
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.319
Never said that either. Allah! Subhan Allah!

493
00:52:24.319 --> 00:52:31.839
And his study habit was such - a small cot with woven rope, a small old broken table

494
00:52:31.839 --> 00:52:36.559
and Hadith Sharif would be open on it. I remember to this day

495
00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:43.520
sometimes Ibn Kathir would be open, meaning Quran commentaries, Hadith Sharif

496
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:49.599
He had to study that, and many other books he would study

497
00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:54.720
And that study was essential - all by lantern light

498
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:59.440
but never said my eyesight has weakened or my hearing has weakened

499
00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:05.680
Sarkar could hear even the softest voice but wouldn't immediately respond

500
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.839
If someone said something, wouldn't reply - for confirmation would ask another

501
00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:17.440
what was said, then would respond. The sequence was

502
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:24.400
first Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Roshan Shah Sahib Roshan Din, the younger brother, passed away

503
00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:30.400
He was very handsome, Masha Allah, and young when he passed away

504
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:35.760
Our burial custom is that women's graves are separate, men's graves are separate

505
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:43.359
Pir Roshan Shah Sahib's grave was made. Then Pir Sarwar Shah Sahib

506
00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:48.640
Baba Ji's grave is in Muzaffarabad Barmala Sharif

507
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:54.319
Then when grandfather passed away, his grave was made beside Baba Ji Zulfan Wali Sarkar

508
00:53:54.319 --> 00:53:59.200
Then Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib passed away

509
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:04.799
and was buried in the adjacent chamber. That's all - nothing special about it

510
00:54:04.799 --> 00:54:10.960
The dust returned to where its origin was. Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah!

511
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.800
Subhan Allah! But this was such an amazing thing

512
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.119
The fact is that throughout his life he never wore glasses. Subhan Allah!

513
00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:22.880
Never wore glasses, and throughout his life never said "What did you say? I can't hear well"

514
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.319
He never said that either. Allah! Subhan Allah!

515
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:31.839
And his dedication to study was such that there was a small rope cot, and here a small

516
00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:36.559
old broken table would be placed, and on it the Hadith Sharif would be open

517
00:54:36.559 --> 00:54:43.520
I still remember that sometimes Tafsir Ibn Kathir would be open, and sometimes the Quran

518
00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:49.599
Kareem's commentaries and Hadith Sharif would be studied. He would do this study, and many other

519
00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:54.720
books were in his regular reading, and this study was mandatory, and that too

520
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:59.440
by lantern light. But he never said "My eyesight has weakened" or "My hearing

521
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:05.680
has weakened." He would hear even the softest word, but wouldn't reply immediately - if

522
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.839
someone made a request, he wouldn't respond right away. For confirmation he would ask another person

523
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:17.440
what was said, then he would respond. The sequence was

524
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:24.400
first Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Roshan Shah Sahib Roshan Din, the younger brother, passed away. He was

525
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:30.400
Masha Allah very handsome and young when he passed away. Now our

526
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.760
burial custom here is that women's graves are separate, men's graves are separate

527
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:43.359
Pir Roshan Shah Sahib's grave was made. And that grave was established at that time. After that

528
00:55:43.359 --> 00:55:48.640
Pir Sarwar Shah Sahib Baba Ji's blessed grave is in Muzaffarabad Barmala Sharif

529
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:54.319
Then when grandfather passed away, his grave was made beside Baba Ji Zulfan Wali Sarkar

530
00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:59.200
Then Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib passed away, and

531
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:04.799
was buried in the adjacent chamber. That's all - nothing special about it. Just

532
00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:10.960
the dust returned to where its origin was. Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah!
