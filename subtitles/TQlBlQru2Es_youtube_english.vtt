1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.480
Now I will humbly request in the blessed presence of Hazrat Qibla Pir Syed Muhammad Shabbir Ali Shah Sahib Gilani

2
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.360
that you quench the thirst of our hearts and enlighten us about the life of Hazrat Baba Ali Sahib

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.279
illuminate our hearts and minds. Nara-e-Takbeer!

4
00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.600
Allahu Akbar! Nara-e-Risalat!

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.920
Allahu Akbar! Nara-e-Risalat!

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.840
Ya Rasool Allah! Nara-e-Takbeer!

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.079
Ya Rasool Allah! Long live Astana Aaliya Chura Sharif!

8
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.440
We praise Him and send blessings upon His Noble Messenger. After that, I seek refuge in Allah the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, the Most Noble

9
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.840
from Satan the accursed. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious

10
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.719
the Most Merciful. First of all, I...

11
00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:58.399
this dignified and simple ceremony, in the series of interviews

12
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.799
questions and answers, in this connection these young people

13
00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.920
Website Chura Sharif organized this

14
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.320
Subhan Allah! And

15
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.560
I also pray that may Allah keep this series of theirs going and continuing

16
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.880
Ameen. The personality about whom this interview is being conducted today

17
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.079
questions and answers are being asked

18
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.520
their status, their greatness, their glory

19
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.640
The purpose is simply this - that by describing their greatness and glory, we want to enlighten our hearts

20
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.360
and minds. Subhan Allah!

21
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.079
Since I have often mentioned before

22
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:13.920
that Darbar Aaliya Chura Sharif is a center, a capital of the exalted Naqshbandiyya Mujaddidiyya order

23
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.280
from which thousands and millions of people have benefited

24
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.440
Subhan Allah! They will continue to benefit

25
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440
Subhan Allah! They are benefiting now

26
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.800
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Today anyone who has any connection with Sufism

27
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.959
or who holds love for the Sufis in their heart

28
00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:49.519
whoever belongs to any spiritual order, whoever is a servant of any saint

29
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.680
whoever follows a Sufi, I will say with great confidence

30
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.360
that when Chura Sharif's name is mentioned, when its discussion begins

31
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.879
there cannot be any scholar, any Sufi, anyone connected to Sufism who is unaware of Chura Sharif

32
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.319
Subhan Allah!

33
00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.720
More than a century has passed since Chura Sharif was established

34
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.879
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! And this chain continues till today - the blessings of Naqshbandiyya Mujaddidiyya are being distributed

35
00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.920
This is not mere talk, I am not just speaking empty words

36
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.519
The sun has come - the evidence of the sun itself

37
00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:50.799
That Baba Ji, the crown of Chura Sharif, your blessed progeny

38
00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:59.120
our forefathers have blessed millions - this is not just something to write or speak about

39
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.480
This is not limited to words - look at that time, all of India

40
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.640
that era, from Afghanistan

41
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.759
to the four corners of the world, especially to Hindustan, to Iran

42
00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:27.280
to Syria and Turkey - this chain of blessings that Baba Ji Sahib or his servants and devotees

43
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.440
the devotees have spread. Subhan Allah!

44
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.680
Subhan Allah! But there was a difficulty - since the circumstances were such

45
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.320
which I will briefly mention

46
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.440
that at that time, confronting the government was not an easy task

47
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.400
But the Mujaddidi traditions were kept alive and that invitation letter

48
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:05.759
either accept the government's authority or become a migrant. They did not accept the government's authority

49
00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:13.280
The government at that time was non-Muslim. They did not submit to the government. Otherwise

50
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.039
thousands of people of that era accepted their authority, who today are playing among thousands and millions

51
00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.160
Subhan Allah!

52
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.320
But Baba Ji, the crown of Chura Sharif, declared that I am a beggar at the door of Mustafa

53
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.440
Allahu Akbar! I have no greater inheritance than this

54
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.479
And if I have any inheritance, it is this torn mat of mine

55
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.840
This blanket on my shoulder, this old cloth, and this water pot of mine

56
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.800
No one can take this away from me

57
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.280
But I will speak only that which pleases Allah and His Messenger

58
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.600
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Now another difficulty was that at that time

59
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:11.360
there was no special media era. There was no written tradition either

60
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.199
But when written documentation began, even that was not sufficient to quench people's thirst

61
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:26.240
And the sad truth is, and all friends will agree

62
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.120
that those who had the right, in my opinion, did not fulfill their duty either. They kept working in their own way

63
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.680
But Alhamdulillah, Baba Ji Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi, Lord of the Worlds

64
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:47.600
Hazoor Baba Ji Pir Syed Noor Muhammad Gilani Rahmatullah Alayhi's name was bright then, is bright now, and will remain bright until the morning of Judgment Day

65
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.840
Hazoor Qibla Alam Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah

66
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.479
known as Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar - they are asking about this personality who was a living example of his predecessors

67
00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:06.800
known as Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar - they are asking about this personality who was a living example of his predecessors

68
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.800
Consider him a picture of the pure Shariah

69
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.080
Consider him a treasure of love for Mustafa

70
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.440
Subhan Allah! On whose lips always

71
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.840
either the support of Quran or the lesson of the life of Mustafa Kareem would be present

72
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.199
Subhan Allah! I will explain further ahead

73
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:43.440
Since there was no media era. This was a worn and weary caravan. It started from Baghdad. It stopped at various places

74
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:52.160
It reached Bukhara. From there, moving forward, this worn caravan, giving lessons of truth, reached the Kurram Agency area of Tirah

75
00:07:52.160 --> 00:08:00.560
Stayed there, then this caravan moved again to North Waziristan, stopped at Akhan Kot

76
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:08.639
From there, this caravan of three or two people moved on. One brother stayed in Tirah Sharif

77
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:16.800
The younger brother, there is a place on the Kohat to Bannu road called Darsamand

78
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.680
Darsamand - this is a common invitation. They settled in Darsamand

79
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.240
Their descendants are still there today. The Sadat Gilani of Darsamand are our paternal cousins

80
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.240
Subhan Allah! A single person, this caravan consisted of four people. First, in 1867 or 68, Chura Sharif was settled

81
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.599
Subhan Allah! A single person, this caravan consisted of four people. First, in 1867 or 68, Chura Sharif was settled

82
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:45.600
Camp was set up. Great difficulties and hardships were endured. But the word of truth was never abandoned

83
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:53.120
Camp was set up. Great difficulties and hardships were endured. But the word of truth was never abandoned

84
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.160
Subhan Allah!

85
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.480
They did not care for worldly property. Hundreds of

86
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:10.160
lands and estates were sent on golden trays saying just speak one word - accept our authority

87
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:16.720
This was at the time when the present district Attock of Chura Sharif did not exist

88
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.360
At that time the district was headquartered at Shahpur

89
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:29.519
This was at that time. But they said no, these estates, these lands mean nothing to me compared to a single piece from the door of Mustafa

90
00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:35.839
Subhan Allah! As Ala Hazrat said - do not fall at the feet of strangers for their scraps

91
00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:39.600
Hazoor Qibla Ala Baba Ji, the story will be long. Pir Haider Shah Badshah, as we have heard - since there is no written record as I said

92
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:46.320
Hazoor Qibla Ala Baba Ji, the story will be long. Pir Haider Shah Badshah, as we have heard - since there is no written record as I said

93
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.320
his birth was in Tirah Sharif. Subhan Allah! He was born in Tirah Sharif

94
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.480
his birth was in Tirah Sharif. Subhan Allah! He was born in Tirah Sharif

95
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:04.000
The chain continued there but these are travelers of another caravan. The first caravan that settled Chura Sharif, they are not from that caravan

96
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.040
They are from the second or third caravan that culminated, they came to Darbar Chura Sharif in that caravan

97
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.399
This was the chain of his birth. Now, Allah knows the truth of what we have heard or seen and read

98
00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:23.360
This was the chain of his birth. Now, Allah knows the truth of what we have heard or seen and read

99
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.839
Who proposed his name? Who gave him the title?

100
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:35.440
Who proposed it? The title - who bestowed it?

101
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:42.160
Subhan Allah! We heard from the elders

102
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.560
that his blessed birth

103
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:55.120
was in Tirah Sharif. The name that was proposed, it was by his grandfather

104
00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.279
Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Faqir Muhammad Rahmatullah Alayhi who proposed it

105
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:04.399
He proposed the name

106
00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:10.640
The first haircut was also given by Hazrat's own hands

107
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.480
Subhan Allah! After giving the haircut, he raised his hands in prayer

108
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.320
saying O my Lord, this prince grandson you have blessed me with, my Lord, I have named him Haider Shah

109
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.160
I have connected his lineage to Maula Murtaza Haider Karrar

110
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.000
Subhan Allah! My Lord, honor the name I have given

111
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.519
And I have also heard that those who were his peers, same age companions, he would tell them even in childhood

112
00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:42.640
and honor my prayer, and may he possess those qualities that Sarkar Maula Murtaza Haider Karrar had. This was the chain of naming

113
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:50.320
Subhan Allah! Now about his childhood

114
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.399
His brother who was an elder

115
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:59.519
I heard from him just one or two things. First was that from childhood, as is the way of the Sufis

116
00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:05.600
I heard from him just one or two things. First was that from childhood, as is the way of the Sufis

117
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:12.959
from childhood there was a chain of piety

118
00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:17.000
there was a chain of God-consciousness

119
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.160
staying away from frivolous talk or any sports and games of that time

120
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.959
There was a practice of piety, from the cradle, and at that time whatever games and play

121
00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:38.320
there were, he would stay away from them. And I've also heard that those who were his peers, his

122
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:46.720
companions of the same age, he would tell them even in childhood, "Brother, we shouldn't play these games"

123
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.560
that brother, we have not come to this world for play and games, to waste our time in games

124
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.240
We have come to this world to do some work. Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah!

125
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:02.560
And we have to do work in this world. So I have heard that his peers would say

126
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.959
what work do we have to do, brother, tell us. He would say the greatest work is that we have to spread the word of truth to the people

127
00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:17.440
and my father's teachings - I have to spread them. Subhan Allah!

128
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.480
This is what I heard. Subhan Allah!

129
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:27.920
These are the childhood circumstances. What else, how else - only Allah knows best

130
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:35.160
These two things I heard, I have presented. Where did he get his early education

131
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.440
and who was among his teachers

132
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:48.480
Just like, from today, some time ago

133
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.279
before

134
00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.639
First

135
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.199
this, in our

136
00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:06.399
elders' and ancestors' homes, this tradition continued that early education was given at home

137
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:13.600
It was given at home because that era was such

138
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:20.720
that the pearls of knowledge distributed at home were very deep and precious

139
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:29.680
And in obtaining education, Baba Ji Sarkar's elders, so early education was from his father

140
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:39.680
and his paternal uncle Hazoor who was a leading scholar of that time

141
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:46.399
His respected father and his uncle Hazrat

142
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:53.199
a genius of his era, whose blessed name was Hazrat Baba Ji Muhammad Syed Muhammad Gul Nabi Shah Rahmatullah Alayhi

143
00:14:53.199 --> 00:15:01.040
Subhan Allah!

144
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.880
Allah bless him. Subhan Allah!

145
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:11.199
He was his paternal uncle who was running the chain of education at that time. Then there was grandfather's education too

146
00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:16.880
His grandfather Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Faqir Pir Muhammad Rahmatullah Alayhi who was the elder brother

147
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:24.800
From the land of Afghanistan to the land of Hindustan, he was called Mulla Ji

148
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:34.000
Since only in Pakistan and India, or perhaps Bangladesh, East Pakistan - this word Mufti is used

149
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.360
but in Afghanistan and other matters, the word Mulla was used. Mulla meant a person of piety, a person of knowledge

150
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.360
and one who has enough knowledge to give a fatwa. And Hazrat's great grandfather

151
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:56.000
His blessed name was Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Deen Muhammad Shah Rahmatullah Alayhi, known as Hazrat Mulla Ji Sahib

152
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.279
His blessed name was Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Deen Muhammad Shah Rahmatullah Alayhi, known as Hazrat Mulla Ji Sahib

153
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:10.560
I have also heard that some benefit was taken from him too, since they had established a proper school here at Chura Sharif

154
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.600
where their progeny and family members were taught. That was the chain of education at that time

155
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.360
where their progeny and family members were taught. That was the chain of education at that time

156
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:28.160
what comes with it - Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar. I have heard

157
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.600
that his brothers who were his contemporaries at that time

158
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.920
in some gathering his elders, grandfather and uncle

159
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:48.639
mentioned something about the Prophet, the Pride of all Creation

160
00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:54.240
the Noble Master, the Beloved, peace be upon him, his blessed shawl

161
00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:02.000
the black shawl, the black blanket. It settled so deeply in his heart

162
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.400
the black shawl, the black blanket. It settled so deeply in his heart

163
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:16.720
that from childhood to youth, from youth till the end, he took black cloth, made it into a shawl

164
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:25.679
and started keeping it not on the right but on the left shoulder, according to the Sunnah. Subhan Allah!

165
00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:33.039
And when someone asked about this black shawl, Sarkar said my Master used a black blanket

166
00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:41.200
so I say this is my Master's Sunnah. Subhan Allah!

167
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.559
And then that black shawl became such a part of life

168
00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:52.400
that he became famous for it. In Chura Sharif, his brothers and elders

169
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.720
made him famous saying Haider Shah Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar

170
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.640
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Even today in Chura Sharif if someone says Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar

171
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.480
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! Even today in Chura Sharif if someone says Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar

172
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:12.240
that Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar means Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi

173
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:18.480
This was the chain of the black shawl. Alhamdulillah

174
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.240
Now the word Badshah - there are two meanings. One is humorous - someone who is carefree, detached

175
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.760
is called Badshah. Another meaning is when someone has kingly qualities, they are called Badshah

176
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.559
is called Badshah. Another meaning is when someone has kingly qualities, they are called Badshah

177
00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:36.960
Now his state of indifference was such

178
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:43.600
Now his state of indifference was such

179
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:50.480
and his state of absorption was such, his closeness to Allah and the Prophet was such that whoever came, big or small, sat down, left, greetings were exchanged, well-being was asked, and that was all

180
00:18:50.480 --> 00:19:01.520
and his state of absorption was such, his closeness to Allah and the Prophet was such that whoever came, big or small, sat down, left, greetings were exchanged, well-being was asked, and that was all

181
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:07.520
and his state of absorption was such, his closeness to Allah and the Prophet was such that whoever came, big or small, sat down, left, greetings were exchanged, well-being was asked, and that was all

182
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:15.760
After that, his royal demeanor was such that

183
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:24.640
he wore very fine clothing his entire life. He used elegant attire

184
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:32.400
He used a beautiful waistcoat. So this relationship was also bestowed from his family

185
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:40.480
His elders would say this son of ours is a king. Subhan Allah!

186
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:49.039
He is a king. Subhan Allah!

187
00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:53.919
Haider Shah Badshah - this word was used. But in the world of Sufism

188
00:19:53.919 --> 00:20:00.400
those who were his contemporaries, I don't know about them. But I will note the reference of Kasur

189
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.919
those who were his contemporaries, I don't know about them. But I will note the reference of Kasur

190
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:03.600
those who were his contemporaries, I don't know about them. But I will note the reference of Kasur

191
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.840
Many people in England are witnesses to this. In Kasur there was a great saint of the Chishti order

192
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:16.559
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Syed Naqeeb Ullah Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi

193
00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:23.679
A reliable companion told me this

194
00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:30.240
that in his gathering, there was mention of Hazoor Baba Ji Qibla Alam Pir Syed Naqeeb Ullah Shah Sahib

195
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:37.280
He was a great Sufi, a great scholar, not ordinary at all. He was a high-ranking

196
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.559
scholar and at that time, the sign of a Pir was that they were great scholars. Subhan Allah!

197
00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:47.039
Subhan Allah!

198
00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:54.240
Among them was Hazrat Baba Ji Sayyidna Naqeeb Ullah Shah Sahib, a perfect Sufi

199
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.520
When his gathering started discussing leisurely, he paid attention and asked whose mention is this

200
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.919
A servant said it's about Chura Sharif. Then in a state of spiritual ecstasy, friends who were his servants here tell us

201
00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:05.280
A servant said it's about Chura Sharif. Then in a state of spiritual ecstasy, friends who were his servants here tell us

202
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.880
that in a strange spiritual state, he said the one you are mentioning, Pir Haider Shah Sahib - he was a king of spiritual path

203
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:17.840
that in a strange spiritual state, he said the one you are mentioning, Pir Haider Shah Sahib - he was a king of spiritual path

204
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:26.240
Subhan Allah!

205
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:33.360
and those after him, the people of Sufism, people of insight, they would acknowledge that he wanted the spiritual path

206
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:41.679
In the name of Allah. This is a tradition that comes in our family, and is in most families

207
00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:43.120
that the family's pledge is within the family. Now whose hand is the pledge on? A person of wisdom understands

208
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:49.679
that the family's pledge is within the family. Now whose hand is the pledge on? A person of wisdom understands

209
00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:56.159
Like my sons, their pledge is to their paternal grandfather's younger brother Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Muhammad Ali Shah Sarkar's blessed hand

210
00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:01.760
Like my sons, their pledge is to their paternal grandfather's younger brother Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Muhammad Ali Shah Sarkar's blessed hand

211
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:09.039
The youngest wasn't there at that time, but Usman Shah, Fazl Usman Shah, Fazl Noman Shah's pledge is on his hand

212
00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:16.159
In this way, this chain continues till today. Pledges also happen outside, like my nephews - may Allah grant them safety

213
00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:24.080
In this way, this chain continues till today. Pledges also happen outside, like my nephews - may Allah grant them safety

214
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:31.440
Yes, Pir Muhammad Ali Shah Sarkar - it is upon his blessed truth-seeking hand. Both, all three

215
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.480
Both or three nephews' pledge is to Hazrat Baba Ji Sarkar Sirhindi Sarkar, probably Muhammad Masum - not Sarhad, Madani

216
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:43.360
Both or three nephews' pledge is to Hazrat Baba Ji Sarkar Sirhindi Sarkar, probably Muhammad Masum - not Sarhad, Madani

217
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:52.559
there are other young men of ours whose pledges are outside. But Alhamdulillah, in the Mujaddidiyya and Naqshbandiyya order

218
00:22:52.559 --> 00:23:00.400
as I have come to know from somewhere that some youth had an inclination towards Hazrat Sarkar Baba Ji Muhammad Fazl Usman Jan Sirhindi

219
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:07.120
their eagerness was towards him. Similarly, Hazrat Baba Ji Sarkar Syed Haider Shah Badshah, Kali Chadar Wali Sarkar's pledge

220
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:13.440
was on his grandfather's hand, whom the world of Sufism knows as Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Faqir Muhammad Rahmatullah Alayhi

221
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:20.480
Subhan Allah! The Khilafats (spiritual successions) he had - he had two Khilafats

222
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:28.720
One Khilafat was bestowed from his grandfather, and the second Khilafat was from his father

223
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:38.240
Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Ahmad Nabi, known as Zulfan Wali Sarkar

224
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:46.240
Subhan Allah!

225
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.880
In 64, at that time I was studying at Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia. But from Chura Sharif at that time

226
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.559
In 64, at that time I was studying at Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia. But from Chura Sharif at that time

227
00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:02.000
In 64, at that time I was studying at Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia. But from Chura Sharif at that time

228
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
In 64, at that time I was studying at Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia. But from Chura Sharif at that time

229
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.799
Respected father Hazrat Baba Ji Syed Ahmad Nabi, known as Zulfan Wali Sarkar, bestowed it

230
00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:20.240
which he would mention with great affection: "I have served two kings and two

231
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.360
his spiritual retreat was at Dhok Mithi Sharif. I would present myself in his service whenever I was free

232
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.600
his spiritual retreat was at Dhok Mithi Sharif. I would present myself in his service whenever I was free

233
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.320
This was before going to Lahore and after. During my student days, it was my good fortune that Sarkar asked

234
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:41.360
what do you do, where are you? I submitted that Sarkar, I am in Lahore. What do you do? I said I study

235
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:48.880
Where do you study? What do you study? I said Dar ul Uloom Jamia Naeemia. He said I know, I know Mufti Muhammad Hussain Naeemi Sahib

236
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:55.279
I said he is among our teachers. He teaches and there are other teaching faculty too

237
00:24:55.279 --> 00:25:01.440
After a silence, he told me that sometimes take out time and visit Data Ganj Bakhsh Ali Hujwiri. Subhan Allah!

238
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:08.960
After a silence, he told me that sometimes take out time and visit Data Ganj Bakhsh Ali Hujwiri. Subhan Allah!

239
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.720
After a silence, he told me that sometimes take out time and visit Data Ganj Bakhsh Ali Hujwiri. Subhan Allah!

240
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.000
Don't be proud of sitting at the head, sit at the feet. Subhan Allah!

241
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.080
Don't be proud of sitting at the head, sit at the feet. Subhan Allah!

242
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.640
And after finishing there, sometimes also visit Allama Iqbal, the Qalandar of Lahore. He will also give you something

243
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:38.799
Subhan Allah! This was one chain. Then I started going. There's a tradition in Lahore

244
00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:43.760
that on Thursdays we must go to Data Sahib, and while passing, we visit Allama Iqbal Rahmatullah Alayhi

245
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.240
The term Lahori Qalandar was used by Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah Rahmatullah Alayhi first. If anyone else claims it, I have no concern

246
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.080
Then I would go there. Now let me tell you something interesting

247
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.600
Two miracles of Allama Iqbal Sahib I will mention that I have seen practically, not just heard

248
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.159
The first was in 60... or 66

249
00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:06.880
I was traveling from Daska and was on a bus. On the way there is a beautiful turn called Nandipur where there's a power station

250
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.520
I was traveling from Daska and was on a bus. On the way there is a beautiful turn called Nandipur where there's a power station

251
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.679
I was traveling from Daska and was on a bus. On the way there is a beautiful turn called Nandipur where there's a power station

252
00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:22.480
When we reached there, a cool breeze blew. It was summer season. A thought came to my mind

253
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:30.000
that I have such love and devotion for Allama Iqbal Rahmatullah Alayhi but he has never guided me till today

254
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.960
that I have such love and devotion for Allama Iqbal Rahmatullah Alayhi but he has never guided me till today

255
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:46.720
I thought just this and my eyes closed. When I dozed off, I saw Allama Sahib standing next to me in the bus

256
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:54.320
I had a book in my hand, it was a student custom then. Whatever was liked was written down

257
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.679
Many verses were written on vehicles that were liked. There was always a pen with me

258
00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:05.679
Then Allama Rahmatullah Alayhi, Lahori Qalandar, said you have complained, so write now. What did he make me write?

259
00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:11.520
Then Allama Rahmatullah Alayhi, Lahori Qalandar, said you have complained, so write now. What did he make me write?

260
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.000
He ordered me to write: This lesson I have learned from Lahori Qalandar. Subhan Allah!

261
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.279
This lesson I have learned from Lahori Qalandar - Being a beggar of Mustafa is better than being Alexander of the world

262
00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:26.240
Subhan Allah!

263
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.720
After that, since Hazrat had instructed to keep visiting Allama Iqbal

264
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:36.240
they will give you something from there. Then once I complained that there are only two or three Naats explicitly titled in your work

265
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.520
You haven't written a Naat with a specific title. So in a dream, Hazrat Allama Lahori Qalandar told me

266
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.159
You haven't written a Naat with a specific title. So in a dream, Hazrat Allama Lahori Qalandar told me

267
00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:50.960
that I have written one Naat which has not been destroyed but is lying in my library. The first verse of that Naat is:

268
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:57.200
The eye of the lover perceives the semi-veil. No matter how much he hides his face in Taiba

269
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.039
hiding it a thousand times. Now regarding training, I would often reach Hazrat's service

270
00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:07.279
From there, book learning was less but practical learning was abundant. Subhan Allah!

271
00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:14.240
From there, book learning was less but practical learning was abundant. Subhan Allah!

272
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.760
Subhan Allah! Allah! You made me note this down, I noted

273
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.000
What was practical learning? Like, I won't attribute this to him, but Azam Lahori has a verse in his Naat

274
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.679
What was practical learning? Like, I won't attribute this to him, but Azam Lahori has a verse in his Naat

275
00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:29.679
What was practical learning? Like, I won't attribute this to him, but Azam Lahori has a verse in his Naat

276
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:37.919
He sits on a mat but is enthroned on the heavens. From there practically, I learned a lesson

277
00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:44.159
Not boast. Practically, this is what was learned there. And as for training, Alhamdulillah whatever is there, it is the blessing of Sarkar's gaze

278
00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:52.640
Subhan Allah! Beautiful moments - each and every moment was beautiful, more beautiful. But in my conscious life

279
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:58.080
Subhan Allah! Beautiful moments - each and every moment was beautiful, more beautiful. But in my conscious life

280
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:04.320
there are many beautiful moments. That time was also beautiful. Today I recall that mats are spread

281
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.960
and the king of Chura Sharif is seated. Subhan Allah! Hazoor Baba Ji is present

282
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:19.360
My respected father is present. Hazoor Qibla Chacha Ji (paternal uncle) is present. Grandfather's younger brother

283
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.919
My respected father is present. Hazoor Qibla Chacha Ji (paternal uncle) is present. Grandfather's younger brother

284
00:29:21.919 --> 00:29:28.320
Hazoor Qibla Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib is present. And his maternal cousin, grandfather who was a great leading scholar of his time

285
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:34.240
a very great leading scholar. His blessed name was Hazoor Qibla Alam Baba Ji Pir Syed Maulana Saeed Ahmad Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi

286
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:39.919
who was a maternal cousin, is seated. And then others including his other maternal cousins

287
00:29:39.919 --> 00:29:46.320
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Syed Muhammad Shafi Rahmatullah Alayhi. And they are

288
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.840
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Syed Muhammad Shafi Rahmatullah Alayhi. And they are

289
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.240
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Syed Muhammad Shafi Rahmatullah Alayhi. And they are

290
00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:04.799
Subhan Allah! Beautiful moments - each moment was beautiful, more beautiful, but from the age of awareness

291
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:13.039
in my life, there were many beautiful moments. That time was also very beautiful - even today I remember

292
00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:17.919
that mats were spread and the kings of Chura Sharif were seated

293
00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:21.440
Subhan Allah! Hazrat Baba Ji was seated in his glory, respected father

294
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:27.279
was present, respected uncle Ji was present, grandfather's brother

295
00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:33.120
the younger one, Hazrat Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib was seated, and your maternal cousin, grandfather

296
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:40.559
who was a very great distinguished scholar of his time, a very great distinguished scholar, his blessed name was

297
00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:46.799
Hazrat Alim Baba Ji Pir Syed Maulana Saeed Ahmad Shah Sahib, may Allah's mercy be upon him, who

298
00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:54.159
was the maternal cousin, he was seated, and then after that other people, including your other

299
00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:59.840
discussing something amongst themselves. The discussion is about a well in the mosque

300
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.919
discussing something amongst themselves. The discussion is about a well in the mosque

301
00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:11.919
whether drinking water from it is permissible or not. This discussion was going on

302
00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:19.279
It was a beautiful moment. Very heated questions and answers were happening

303
00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:25.360
And in this Q&A, what did Baba Ji say? He said my teacher - he didn't say which one

304
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.799
had said that if the well is endowed for the mosque, then its water is not for the general public but for the worshippers

305
00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:36.640
If it's general, then the public can take water from it. Now this well is in the mosque

306
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.960
They said build a small wall and put it outside the mosque's corner, so people can also drink

307
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.240
That was a beautiful moment. It was my childhood and those brothers, Masha Allah, were engaged in heated discussions

308
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:52.240
Similarly, I remember one phrase about this mourning food we cook in Pakistan

309
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.919
In our area we call it Khairat. The mourning food that's cooked. In our Azad Kashmir too

310
00:31:57.919 --> 00:32:01.679
I don't remember much. Just that someone said is it permissible or not? Some discussion was going on

311
00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:06.159
Baba Ji smiled and said to Maulana Mian Saeed Shah Sahib - I know this much that mourning food is for travelers

312
00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:11.679
Keep this food as food, don't make it a feast. If you make it a feast, perhaps there won't be a permissible way

313
00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:16.320
But if you make it a necessity, perhaps this matter will resolve. Those were beautiful moments

314
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:21.760
Those beautiful moments are still before me. Sometimes traveling on horseback with a caravan of devotees

315
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:27.039
Those beautiful moments are still before me. Sometimes traveling on horseback with a caravan of devotees

316
00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:31.440
Sometimes talking about Madinah Tayyibah, tears flowing from eyes. And what Naat was being recited

317
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:36.720
Sometimes talking about Madinah Tayyibah, tears flowing from eyes. And what Naat was being recited

318
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:43.600
A Naat was being recited: The cool shadows of your fasts, the cold breezes, O Wearer of the Blanket

319
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.960
And I remember two or three verses of another Naat. What beautiful moments they were

320
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:55.039
I remember till today that Naat which was: Every moment I await, of the Lord of the Black Blanket

321
00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:59.519
My eyes keep looking towards the paths of the Arabian camel riders

322
00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:05.200
That Naat was being recited. Those were beautiful moments. But since it was childhood

323
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:12.000
In 64, he passed away. These two or three things are preserved in my mind

324
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.840
Look, the thing is that when Pakistan came into existence, this is a long political question but I'll be brief

325
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:19.039
When it was time to create Pakistan, in India's - if I say 100 percent, it's still correct - 99 percent

326
00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:25.120
of the Mashaikh were determined to create Pakistan. Subhan Allah!

327
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.480
of the Mashaikh were determined to create Pakistan. Subhan Allah!

328
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.640
And the slogan was: We will create Pakistan. The cry was: We will take Pakistan. Subhan Allah!

329
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.720
In this regard, Hazrat's residence was in Lahore, Wasal Pura, Chowk Piranwala

330
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.840
In this regard, Hazrat's residence was in Lahore, Wasal Pura, Chowk Piranwala

331
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.279
In this regard, Hazrat's residence was in Lahore, Wasal Pura, Chowk Piranwala

332
00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:54.240
In this regard, Hazrat's residence was in Lahore, Wasal Pura, Chowk Piranwala

333
00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:03.600
In this regard, Hazrat's residence was in Lahore, Wasal Pura, Chowk Piranwala

334
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:11.599
Maulana Muhammad Bakhsh Muslim D Rahmatullah Alayhi was the special advisor to Hazrat Baba Ji Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Quaid-e-Azam

335
00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:13.599
Quaid-e-Azam Sahib said that Muslim Sahib's matter doesn't seem to be working out

336
00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:19.359
Quaid-e-Azam Sahib said that Muslim Sahib's matter doesn't seem to be working out

337
00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:21.200
What should we do? Muslim Sahib said there is a Pir, an elder who has great influence in politics

338
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:29.359
The world calls him Pir Jamaat Ali Shah. If he comes under our influence, it would be great

339
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:36.879
When you went to him - now if anyone denies this, that's their choice, but what Muslim Sahib himself told me

340
00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:43.119
Now I don't know what permissions were sought. In any case, Pakistan should be created

341
00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:47.679
Muslim Sahib took Muhammad Ali Jinnah and presented himself to Baba Ji in Wasal Pura

342
00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:52.960
He came with a message. Baba Ji said tomorrow. The next day he summoned Amir-e-Millat

343
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:59.680
Hazrat Hafiz Ji Rahmatullah Alayhi came to him. He said Jamaat Ali Shah, I command you

344
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:07.200
to start a nationwide movement and go out with the flag of Pakistan. Allah will make you successful

345
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:12.960
Subhan Allah! Then Hazrat Amir-e-Millat submitted: Hazrat, if Pakistan is created, I will go out

346
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:18.960
If it's not created, what will happen? Sarkar said: Jamaat Ali Shah, this has been approved from the Court above

347
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.560
Subhan Allah! This has been approved from the Court above

348
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:26.320
Subhan Allah! This has been approved from the Court above

349
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:34.880
Subhan Allah!

350
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:42.000
he would say in Punjabi: Oh brother, my liver became cold, my liver became satisfied

351
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.560
And then after that, the fatwa that was issued - the truth should be told

352
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:56.320
The fatwa that was issued from Kuchocha Sharif - the present Hashmi Mian Sahib, their grandfather

353
00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.480
issued the fatwa. Samja Hasan Shah Sahib Rahmatullah Alayhi, Muhaddith Kuchochvi

354
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.320
The fatwa was that a Muslim who doesn't vote for Muslim League, if he dies, don't bury him in a Muslim cemetery

355
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:12.800
This was a very sensitive and strict fatwa. And this fatwa was verified by Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Haider Shah

356
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.560
Subhan Allah!

357
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.760
Subhan Allah!

358
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.040
Many religious institutions are established. The institutions named Jamia Haideria

359
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.359
You also have Jamia Haideria running. And Alhamdulillah there's one in Chura Sharif

360
00:36:25.359 --> 00:36:27.839
You also have Jamia Haideria running. And Alhamdulillah there's one in Chura Sharif

361
00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:32.960
in Lahore too, in Rawalpindi too there's an institution running

362
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.720
In Peer Badai near Fauji Colony, Alhamdulillah Jamia Haideria Mujaddidiyya is running

363
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.680
Similarly locally one is running in Mithi Sharif too, Jamia Haideria. In Lahore too. Then in Hanjer Rayald

364
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.280
near Gujranwala, there too. Many institutions are attributed to Baba Ji's name

365
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:55.359
Because whatever we get is the charity and blessing of your name

366
00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:59.760
And it's our duty as servants that wherever we establish an institution, we attribute it to Hazrat's name

367
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.800
Subhan Allah! As for patronage, in Lahore, since part of his life was spent there

368
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.359
He greatly patronized Ahzab ul Anaf, patronized Jamia Naemania

369
00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:13.839
And as for mosques, he had many mosques built

370
00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:19.760
And as for mosques, he had many mosques built

371
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.400
Many mosques were built, he left imams there and took their salary and maintenance upon himself

372
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.640
saying your only duty is to lead prayers and teach children the Quran. Subhan Allah!

373
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.760
Teach the Quran, teach Hadith

374
00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:37.119
But after that, if any representative of any school came to him in any matter, he wouldn't send them empty-handed

375
00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:42.320
He would always bestow something, patronize them. We have many proofs of where all he patronized

376
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:48.560
Even in Makkah Mukarramah, there was a school, its name was Salafiyya, Jamia Salafiyya

377
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:55.520
But at that time it wasn't made into a particular sect. We have correspondence from there too

378
00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.880
that Sarkar used to patronize them too. And during that time, there was also a school in Madinah Tayyibah

379
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.839
which he patronized and sent his share there

380
00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:09.920
the school that was established, at that time Sarkar used to patronize that too

381
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.119
And annually he would send them cash and would say with great joy

382
00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:18.720
Brothers, all the charity we receive is due to Hazrat Mujaddid Pak's blessing

383
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:24.079
so why shouldn't we serve wholeheartedly? Subhan Allah!

384
00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:31.359
But you cannot even imagine how strict was the adherence to Shariah

385
00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:38.320
The adherence to Shariah was such that even in gatherings no one could do anything wrong

386
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.040
I remember a religious scholar came - I won't mention his name - he had tied

387
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:48.240
a turban with a very large tassel. Sarkar called him close with affection

388
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.880
a turban with a very large tassel. Sarkar called him close with affection

389
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.640
and said, Maulana, I have read that a small tassel is permissible

390
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:04.079
but keeping such a large one exceeds the limits. Allah!

391
00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:10.000
Similarly, even young girls were not allowed to recite Quran loudly

392
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.760
There was restriction on them too. Similarly, I observed that when

393
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:22.480
Sarkar would put on blessed sandals, he would put the right foot in first

394
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:28.240
Subhan Allah! And if anyone made a mistake, he would correct them

395
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.880
matters we have, that too was under his patronage - Sarkar would guide, and in that era Medina

396
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.520
that all companions would eat together and he would say, say Bismillah loudly

397
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:44.079
so that each one can hear the other

398
00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:48.960
And there are many such matters - how many should I enumerate?

399
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:55.440
But it wasn't harsh - there was no strictness. There was a way of explaining

400
00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.400
with gentleness, not harshness. He would explain in a unique manner

401
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:05.680
Two elders from our Azad Kashmir, District Kotli, went to meet him

402
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:14.240
His descendants are all in Bolton. The other who came to meet was Hakim Wilayat Khan

403
00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:18.000
His descendants are also in Bolton. Hakim Wilayat Khan didn't have a beard - he used to shave

404
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.839
And Maulana Baqir Ali Sahib, being a Maulvi, had kept a beard

405
00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:30.320
So Baba Ji Sarkar asked Maulvi Baqir Ali Khan - has it been applied?

406
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:36.800
He replied yes. Then asked the other one - has it been applied?

407
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:43.280
He said, wait a moment. Allahu Akbar!

408
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.240
Didn't say anything - wait a moment. They sat for one or two minutes

409
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:51.920
and then Hakim Sahib used to say that much time passed but my wish was

410
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.520
that when I present myself at Baba Ji's court, the Sunnah of Mustafa should be on my face

411
00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:01.920
that when I present myself at Baba Ji's court, the Sunnah of Mustafa should be on my face

412
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.960
Subhan Allah! This was a practice - once a companion stood up to drink water

413
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.560
Sarkar gestured for him to sit down. When he sat, Sarkar said

414
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.680
My Master the Prophet has said to drink water while sitting

415
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.160
Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! So these were many things. And another interesting thing

416
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.359
is that there was a Maulana, his name was Maulana Muhammad Fazl-e-Ilahi Rahmatullah Alayh

417
00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:26.880
In Baba Ji's gatherings, his duty was to give lessons in Hadith

418
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:33.280
Subhan Allah! Hazoor himself would listen, the companions would listen too

419
00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:38.880
And wouldn't say this was wrong - would say this point was missed by Maulana Sahib

420
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.680
Since such things can be missed, it came to my mind so let me complete it

421
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.240
This was the style of teaching with love

422
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:54.560
The wealth of love for the Prophet - even today, Alhamdulillah, my noble family

423
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:59.760
is filled to the brim with it. Subhan Allah!

424
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:05.839
Now see, there was a great scholar in Pakistan named Maulana Abdul Ghafoor

425
00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:11.920
Ghazalvi Rahmatullah Alayh, Sheikh-ul-Quran. Masha Allah, Subhan Allah!

426
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.160
He was delivering a sermon and looked around

427
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.480
and addressed Zahuri Sahib and Maulana Muhammad Hussain Gulfurosh

428
00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.680
He said, Brother Gulfurosh, tell Zahuri that here at Chura Sharif, speak very carefully

429
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:33.440
Here the ocean of love for Mustafa must be navigated carefully

430
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:39.200
And if I slip slightly, young Sahihzadas are sitting here - don't think them small

431
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.280
they will catch me immediately. This is the situation

432
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.119
And I still remember the gathering at Khanqah Chura Sharif

433
00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:52.720
Hazoor Qibla Zia-ul-Ummat Pir Muhammad Karam Shah Al-Azhari

434
00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.040
Allah! He was speaking and the scene was that

435
00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.760
the Sahihzadas were swaying and tears were flowing from their eyes

436
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:07.359
When they stood for Salam and this verse was recited - those whose prostration

437
00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:11.119
the mihrab of Kaaba used to bow for

438
00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:14.400
Ask anyone who was there - Pir Karam Shah Azhari also fell into prostration

439
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.440
The Sahihzadas also fell into prostration, and all the people fell into prostration

440
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.440
And the one reciting Salam repeated this verse approximately 18 times

441
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.920
Subhan Allah! And when he stopped, he said, for God's sake

442
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:34.319
please raise your heads, I don't understand what to do

443
00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:42.960
and in the pocket a watch. Blessed staff in hand

444
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.280
and ask them any question - see what happens. And even today our state here is

445
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.800
and ask them any question - see what happens. And even today our state here is

446
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.560
that when the youth gather together - we are the old ones among them

447
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:59.200
When we sit together, I often tell the Sahihzadas

448
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:07.680
You understand - he's a very good Naat reciter. And Ali Abbas Shah Sahib

449
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:15.040
has a beautiful voice. And Hazrat Maulana Allama Sahihzada Muhammad Farooq-ul-Islam

450
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:22.480
and recites beautiful Naat. Similarly among young Sahihzadas, Razi Abbas Sahib

451
00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:27.599
is my cousin - son of my very affectionate uncle

452
00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:32.480
All of them recite Naat together. Just a year ago, we were sitting in the mosque

453
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.000
All of them recite Naat together. Just a year ago, we were sitting in the mosque

454
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.599
so create some atmosphere. They said we'll create it right now

455
00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:48.400
And they created such an atmosphere - three of them sat together and started reciting Naat

456
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.640
And that Naat was - we were sitting inside Baba Ji's mosque

457
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.240
The Naat was: The river of Your mercy flows openly

458
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.680
Subhan Allah! I'm receiving alms, my work is progressing

459
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:06.160
Subhan Allah! Your name is above the Throne, Your name is everywhere

460
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.079
And when they reached the final verse

461
00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:13.200
that whatever I have is the charity of Mustafa, this slave lives on Your scraps

462
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.680
All the Sahihzadas sitting in the mosque - screams and wails could be heard

463
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.560
Alhamdulillah, the wealth of love for Mustafa was being distributed then

464
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.160
and even today it is being distributed. Every young person, Alhamdulillah

465
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.960
and even today it is being distributed. Every young person, Alhamdulillah

466
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:37.200
you will find is practicing religion with love for Mustafa Karim in their heart

467
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:42.800
And especially in this era when great people are wavering

468
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.440
Sahihzadas are wavering - but I say with pride that my Baba Ji's descendants

469
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:53.280
the youth, even today in matters of creed are so firm and steadfast

470
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.599
that no one can shake them or challenge them

471
00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:03.119
The state of love for Mustafa is such that wherever you go - Ramadan in Madinah Munawwarah

472
00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:07.599
Alhamdulillah, Chura Sharif is being represented. Go for Hajj

473
00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:13.599
the apple of my Baba Ji's eyes, my Baba Ji's pure progeny, Alhamdulillah

474
00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:17.680
each one better than the other is spreading this wealth of love

475
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:23.760
At that time there were ships - steamers they called them

476
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:29.359
Ships departed from Bombay - that was the port for all India

477
00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:33.839
and in the pocket a watch. Blessed staff in hand

478
00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:37.280
There were multiple attendances. Hajj at that time wasn't easy - it took 3-4 months

479
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.000
Even going for Hajj took 3-4 months. So there were multiple attendances

480
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.640
I don't have exact numbers but there were many blessed attendances

481
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.960
of Baba Ji Sahib in Madinah Tayyibah. Subhan Allah!

482
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.359
This is also a good question. The elders of that time, those who were peers of his

483
00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:58.480
This is also a good question. The elders of that time, those who were peers of his

484
00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.119
after hearing this, each would teach their own spiritual path

485
00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:07.839
For example, I'll mention Golra Sharif as a reference

486
00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:14.160
It's a sad thing today that there's a strange jealousy in hearts

487
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:19.359
People don't even like to mention others' names. We weren't taught this

488
00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:23.280
We were taught that one who is miserly can never become a Faqir

489
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:29.040
He can never become a Sufi - one who is miserly. Indeed! Subhan Allah!

490
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:35.440
and refresh our faith. Darbar Aaliya Golra Sharif is a great Khanqah of Chishti order

491
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:41.040
And on their pulpit, two books were always present

492
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.200
And on their pulpit, two books were always present

493
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:50.560
One was Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi's Fusus al-Hikam and one was Masnavi Sharif

494
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.720
Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Mehr Ali Shah would regularly teach these. Subhan Allah!

495
00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.319
and in the pocket a watch. Blessed staff in hand

496
00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:04.480
especially Baba Ji Sahib would regularly at night quote from Maktubat Sharif

497
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.760
of Hazrat Mujaddid Pak and speak. The phrase would be: My Imam Rabbani has said this

498
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.960
My Imam Rabbani has said this. Allahu Akbar!

499
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:21.520
This tradition continued - almost daily after Maghrib prayers

500
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:28.319
this practice would continue. The phrase was always: My Imam Rabbani has said this

501
00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:33.839
And he would often say, read Maktubat Sharif

502
00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:38.480
The blessed gathering - how do I describe it? Just understand it was like several suns

503
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.720
The blessed gathering - how do I describe it? Just understand it was like several suns

504
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:47.280
several moons. Subhan Allah! White face. Subhan Allah!

505
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.960
And on the head, a white blessed turban. Subhan Allah!

506
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:57.680
On the shoulders, a black shawl. Locks flowing

507
00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.800
As Riaz-ud-Din Sahib has a verse of Naat

508
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.920
I'm not attributing it to them, it's a Naat verse

509
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.319
about the blessed locks swaying, displaying the glory of the Prophet

510
00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:17.839
Swaying locks demonstrating the honor of the Trustworthy One

511
00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:22.160
I don't know if this Naat is recited anymore - Riaz-ud-Din Sordi Sahib recited it to me

512
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.160
I don't know if this Naat is recited anymore - Riaz-ud-Din Sordi Sahib recited it to me

513
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.520
in Madinah Pak 20-25 years ago. So the locks, white blessed beard

514
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:37.760
practicing Shariah, Masha Allah! Good height, reddish complexion

515
00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.800
shawl on shoulders of light pearl color. Sometimes white Boski coat with a chain

516
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:49.839
and in the pocket a watch. Blessed staff in hand

517
00:49:49.839 --> 00:49:51.119
The staff would come up to here - to the waist. And the walking style

518
00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:57.119
The staff would come up to here - to the waist. And the walking style

519
00:49:57.119 --> 00:50:04.800
was neither fast nor slow - moderate. And not in the habit of talking while walking

520
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:10.480
When walking, walk silently. Don't talk while standing

521
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.880
When you start walking, just walk. This was the style. What more can I tell you

522
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:19.280
what he was like, how he was. That blessed sight is now forgotten. Subhan Allah!

523
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:25.599
From one mother's lineage, the eldest was Pir Haider Shah Sahib

524
00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:31.119
From one mother's lineage, the eldest was Pir Haider Shah Sahib

525
00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:34.559
The younger one was Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib

526
00:50:34.559 --> 00:50:37.359
The younger one was Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib

527
00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:42.000
Younger than them was Pir Roshan Shah Sahib

528
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.480
But during this time, Hazoor's mother passed away and Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji

529
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.040
But during this time, Hazoor's mother passed away and Hazoor Qibla Baba Ji

530
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.280
Zulfan Wali Sarkar married a second time from Muzaffarabad

531
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:58.079
From that Mai Sahiba, one son was born. She also passed away

532
00:50:58.079 --> 00:51:01.760
From that Mai Sahiba, one son was born. She also passed away

533
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:08.880
That son - Mian Ghulam Rasool Sahib from Muzaffarabad

534
00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:12.359
Barmala - our cousin family still lives there

535
00:51:12.559 --> 00:51:18.880
These Muzaffarabad Gilanis are our cousin family - we have relations with them

536
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:24.880
whether from Muzaffarabad, or Garhi Dupatta, or Bangla Saidaan

537
00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.200
That Sahihzada's blessed name was Baba Ji Pir Sarwar Shah Rahmatullah Alayh

538
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:36.400
meaning age-wise he was the youngest of all

539
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:45.440
The atmosphere was such that no one felt different. Their appearance

540
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:50.319
showed they were brothers. Very few people knew their mothers were different

541
00:51:50.319 --> 00:51:56.079
He was also Masha Allah very handsome and beautiful

542
00:51:56.079 --> 00:52:02.559
Sarkar's blessed age - when he passed away

543
00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:07.760
he himself had mentioned somewhere that his age was around 125 years

544
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:12.240
he himself had mentioned somewhere that his age was around 125 years

545
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.800
Subhan Allah! But the amazing thing was

546
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.200
that he never wore glasses his entire life. Subhan Allah!

547
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.680
Never wore glasses and never said that he couldn't hear properly

548
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.240
Never wore glasses and never said that he couldn't hear properly

549
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:32.079
And his study habit was such - a small cot with woven rope, a small old broken table

550
00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:36.240
and Hadith Sharif would be open on it. I remember to this day

551
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.520
sometimes Ibn Kathir would be open, meaning Quran commentaries, Hadith Sharif

552
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:46.000
sometimes Ibn Kathir would be open, meaning Quran commentaries, Hadith Sharif

553
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:54.559
And that study was essential - all by lantern light

554
00:52:54.559 --> 00:53:00.480
but never said my eyesight has weakened or my hearing has weakened

555
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.359
Sarkar could hear even the softest voice but wouldn't immediately respond

556
00:53:05.359 --> 00:53:09.599
If someone said something, wouldn't reply - for confirmation would ask another

557
00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:13.119
what was said, then would respond. The sequence was

558
00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:17.680
what was said, then would respond. The sequence was

559
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:23.040
first Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Roshan Shah Sahib Roshan Din, the younger brother, passed away

560
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.040
He was very handsome, Masha Allah, and young when he passed away

561
00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:32.880
He was very handsome, Masha Allah, and young when he passed away

562
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:38.240
Our burial custom is that women's graves are separate, men's graves are separate

563
00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:43.440
Pir Roshan Shah Sahib's grave was made. Then Pir Sarwar Shah Sahib

564
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:48.240
Baba Ji's grave is in Muzaffarabad Barmala Sharif

565
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.520
Then when grandfather passed away, his grave was made beside Baba Ji Zulfan Wali Sarkar

566
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.839
Then Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib passed away

567
00:53:57.839 --> 00:54:02.720
and was buried in the adjacent chamber. That's all - nothing special about it

568
00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:11.280
The dust returned to where its origin was. Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah!

569
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.800
Subhan Allah! But this was such an amazing thing

570
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.119
The fact is that throughout his life he never wore glasses. Subhan Allah!

571
00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:22.880
Never wore glasses, and throughout his life never said "What did you say? I can't hear well"

572
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.319
Never wore glasses, and throughout his life never said "What did you say? I can't hear well"

573
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:31.839
And his dedication to study was such that there was a small rope cot, and here a small

574
00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:36.559
old broken table would be placed, and on it the Hadith Sharif would be open

575
00:54:36.559 --> 00:54:43.520
I still remember that sometimes Tafsir Ibn Kathir would be open, and sometimes the Quran

576
00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:49.599
Kareem's commentaries and Hadith Sharif would be studied. He would do this study, and many other

577
00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:54.720
books were in his regular reading, and this study was mandatory, and that too

578
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:59.440
by lantern light. But he never said "My eyesight has weakened" or "My hearing

579
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:05.680
has weakened." He would hear even the softest word, but wouldn't reply immediately - if

580
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.839
someone made a request, he wouldn't respond right away. For confirmation he would ask another person

581
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:17.440
what was said, then he would respond. The sequence was

582
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:24.400
first Hazrat Baba Ji Pir Roshan Shah Sahib Roshan Din, the younger brother, passed away. He was

583
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:30.400
Masha Allah very handsome and young when he passed away. Now our

584
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.760
burial custom here is that women's graves are separate, men's graves are separate

585
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:43.359
Pir Roshan Shah Sahib's grave was made. And that grave was established at that time. After that

586
00:55:43.359 --> 00:55:48.640
Pir Sarwar Shah Sahib Baba Ji's blessed grave is in Muzaffarabad Barmala Sharif

587
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:54.319
Then when grandfather passed away, his grave was made beside Baba Ji Zulfan Wali Sarkar

588
00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:59.200
Then Pir Mahboob Shah Sahib passed away, and

589
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:04.799
was buried in the adjacent chamber. That's all - nothing special about it. Just

590
00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:10.960
the dust returned to where its origin was. Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah!
